=== CANTO 1 ===
1	Midway upon the journey of our life
2	I found myself within a forest dark,
3	For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
4	Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
5	What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
6	Which in the very thought renews the fear.
7	So bitter is it, death is little more;
8	But of the good to treat, which there I found,
9	Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
10	I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
11	So full was I of slumber at the moment
12	In which I had abandoned the true way.
13	But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,
14	At that point where the valley terminated,
15	Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
16	Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
17	Vested already with that planet’s rays
18	Which leadeth others right by every road.
19	Then was the fear a little quieted
20	That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout
21	The night, which I had passed so piteously.
22	And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
23	Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
24	Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
25	So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
26	Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
27	Which never yet a living person left.
28	After my weary body I had rested,
29	The way resumed I on the desert slope,
30	So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
31	And lo! almost where the ascent began,
32	A panther light and swift exceedingly,
33	Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!
34	And never moved she from before my face,
35	Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
36	That many times I to return had turned.
37	The time was the beginning of the morning,
38	And up the sun was mounting with those stars
39	That with him were, what time the Love Divine
40	At first in motion set those beauteous things;
41	So were to me occasion of good hope,
42	The variegated skin of that wild beast,
43	The hour of time, and the delicious season;
44	But not so much, that did not give me fear
45	A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.
46	He seemed as if against me he were coming
47	With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
48	So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
49	And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
50	Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
51	And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
52	She brought upon me so much heaviness,
53	With the affright that from her aspect came,
54	That I the hope relinquished of the height.
55	And as he is who willingly acquires,
56	And the time comes that causes him to lose,
57	Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
58	E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,
59	Which, coming on against me by degrees
60	Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
61	While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
62	Before mine eyes did one present himself,
63	Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
64	When I beheld him in the desert vast,
65	“Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,
66	“Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”
67	He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,
68	And both my parents were of Lombardy,
69	And Mantuans by country both of them.
70	‘Sub Julio’ was I born, though it was late,
71	And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
72	During the time of false and lying gods.
73	A poet was I, and I sang that just
74	Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
75	After that Ilion the superb was burned.
76	But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
77	Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable,
78	Which is the source and cause of every joy?”
79	“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
80	Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”
81	I made response to him with bashful forehead.
82	“O, of the other poets honour and light,
83	Avail me the long study and great love
84	That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
85	Thou art my master, and my author thou,
86	Thou art alone the one from whom I took
87	The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
88	Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
89	Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
90	For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”
91	“Thee it behoves to take another road,”
92	Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
93	“If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
94	Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
95	Suffers not any one to pass her way,
96	But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
97	And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
98	That never doth she glut her greedy will,
99	And after food is hungrier than before.
100	Many the animals with whom she weds,
101	And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
102	Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
103	He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
104	But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
105	’Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
106	Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
107	On whose account the maid Camilla died,
108	Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
109	Through every city shall he hunt her down,
110	Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
111	There from whence envy first did let her loose.
112	Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
113	Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
114	And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
115	Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
116	Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
117	Who cry out each one for the second death;
118	And thou shalt see those who contented are
119	Within the fire, because they hope to come,
120	Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;
121	To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
122	A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
123	With her at my departure I will leave thee;
124	Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
125	In that I was rebellious to his law,
126	Wills that through me none come into his city.
127	He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
128	There is his city and his lofty throne;
129	O happy he whom thereto he elects!”
130	And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,
131	By that same God whom thou didst never know,
132	So that I may escape this woe and worse,
133	Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
134	That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
135	And those thou makest so disconsolate.”
136	Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.

=== CANTO 2 ===
137	Day was departing, and the embrowned air
138	Released the animals that are on earth
139	From their fatigues; and I the only one
140	Made myself ready to sustain the war,
141	Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
142	Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
143	O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
144	O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
145	Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
146	And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,
147	Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
148	Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.
149	Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
150	While yet corruptible, unto the world
151	Immortal went, and was there bodily.
152	But if the adversary of all evil
153	Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
154	That issue would from him, and who, and what,
155	To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
156	For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
157	In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
158	The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
159	Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
160	Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
161	Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
162	Things did he hear, which the occasion were
163	Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
164	Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
165	To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
166	Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.
167	But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
168	I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
169	Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
170	Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
171	I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
172	Thou’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”
173	And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
174	And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
175	So that from his design he quite withdraws,
176	Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
177	Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
178	Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
179	“If I have well thy language understood,”
180	Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
181	“Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
182	Which many times a man encumbers so,
183	It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
184	As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.
185	That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
186	I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
187	At the first moment when I grieved for thee.
188	Among those was I who are in suspense,
189	And a fair, saintly Lady called to me
190	In such wise, I besought her to command me.
191	Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
192	And she began to say, gentle and low,
193	With voice angelical, in her own language:
194	‘O spirit courteous of Mantua,
195	Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
196	And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
197	A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
198	Upon the desert slope is so impeded
199	Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
200	And may, I fear, already be so lost,
201	That I too late have risen to his succour,
202	From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
203	Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
204	And with what needful is for his release,
205	Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
206	Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
207	I come from there, where I would fain return;
208	Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
209	When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
210	Full often will I praise thee unto him.’
211	Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
212	‘O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
213	The human race exceedeth all contained
214	Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
215	So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
216	To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;
217	No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.
218	But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
219	The here descending down into this centre,
220	From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’
221	‘Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
222	Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,
223	‘Why I am not afraid to enter here.
224	Of those things only should one be afraid
225	Which have the power of doing others harm;
226	Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
227	God in his mercy such created me
228	That misery of yours attains me not,
229	Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
230	A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
231	At this impediment, to which I send thee,
232	So that stern judgment there above is broken.
233	In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
234	And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need
235	Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”
236	Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
237	Hastened away, and came unto the place
238	Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
239	“Beatrice” said she, “the true praise of God,
240	Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
241	For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
242	Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
243	Dost thou not see the death that combats him
244	Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”
245	Never were persons in the world so swift
246	To work their weal and to escape their woe,
247	As I, after such words as these were uttered,
248	Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
249	Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
250	Which honours thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’
251	After she thus had spoken unto me,
252	Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
253	Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
254	And unto thee I came, as she desired;
255	I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
256	Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.
257	What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay?
258	Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
259	Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
260	Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
261	Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
262	And so much good my speech doth promise thee?”
263	Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
264	Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
265	Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
266	Such I became with my exhausted strength,
267	And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
268	That I began, like an intrepid person:
269	“O she compassionate, who succoured me,
270	And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
271	The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
272	Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
273	To the adventure, with these words of thine,
274	That to my first intent I have returned.
275	Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
276	Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”
277	Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
278	I entered on the deep and savage way.

=== CANTO 3 ===
279	“Through me the way is to the city dolent;
280	Through me the way is to eternal dole;
281	Through me the way among the people lost.
282	Justice incited my sublime Creator;
283	Created me divine Omnipotence,
284	The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
285	Before me there were no created things,
286	Only eterne, and I eternal last.
287	All hope abandon, ye who enter in!”
288	These words in sombre colour I beheld
289	Written upon the summit of a gate;
290	Whence I: “Their sense is, Master, hard to me!”
291	And he to me, as one experienced:
292	“Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
293	All cowardice must needs be here extinct.
294	We to the place have come, where I have told thee
295	Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
296	Who have foregone the good of intellect.”
297	And after he had laid his hand on mine
298	With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
299	He led me in among the secret things.
300	There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
301	Resounded through the air without a star,
302	Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
303	Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
304	Accents of anger, words of agony,
305	And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
306	Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
307	For ever in that air for ever black,
308	Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
309	And I, who had my head with horror bound,
310	Said: “Master, what is this which now I hear?
311	What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?”
312	And he to me: “This miserable mode
313	Maintain the melancholy souls of those
314	Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
315	Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
316	Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
317	Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
318	The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
319	Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
320	For glory none the damned would have from them.”
321	And I: “O Master, what so grievous is
322	To these, that maketh them lament so sore?”
323	He answered: “I will tell thee very briefly.
324	These have no longer any hope of death;
325	And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
326	They envious are of every other fate.
327	No fame of them the world permits to be;
328	Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
329	Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.”
330	And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
331	Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
332	That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
333	And after it there came so long a train
334	Of people, that I ne’er would have believed
335	That ever Death so many had undone.
336	When some among them I had recognised,
337	I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
338	Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
339	Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
340	That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
341	Hateful to God and to his enemies.
342	These miscreants, who never were alive,
343	Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
344	By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
345	These did their faces irrigate with blood,
346	Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
347	By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
348	And when to gazing farther I betook me.
349	People I saw on a great river’s bank;
350	Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,
351	That I may know who these are, and what law
352	Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
353	As I discern athwart the dusky light.”
354	And he to me: “These things shall all be known
355	To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
356	Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”
357	Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
358	Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
359	From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
360	And lo! towards us coming in a boat
361	An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
362	Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
363	Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
364	I come to lead you to the other shore,
365	To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
366	And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
367	Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!”
368	But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
369	He said: “By other ways, by other ports
370	Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
371	A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”
372	And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;
373	It is so willed there where is power to do
374	That which is willed; and farther question not.”
375	Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
376	Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
377	Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
378	But all those souls who weary were and naked
379	Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
380	As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
381	God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
382	The human race, the place, the time, the seed
383	Of their engendering and of their birth!
384	Thereafter all together they drew back,
385	Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
386	Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
387	Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
388	Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
389	Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
390	As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
391	First one and then another, till the branch
392	Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
393	In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
394	Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
395	At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
396	So they depart across the dusky wave,
397	And ere upon the other side they land,
398	Again on this side a new troop assembles.
399	“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,
400	“All those who perish in the wrath of God
401	Here meet together out of every land;
402	And ready are they to pass o’er the river,
403	Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
404	So that their fear is turned into desire.
405	This way there never passes a good soul;
406	And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
407	Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”
408	This being finished, all the dusk champaign
409	Trembled so violently, that of that terror
410	The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
411	The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
412	And fulminated a vermilion light,
413	Which overmastered in me every sense,
414	And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.

=== CANTO 4 ===
415	Broke the deep lethargy within my head
416	A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
417	Like to a person who by force is wakened;
418	And round about I moved my rested eyes,
419	Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
420	To recognise the place wherein I was.
421	True is it, that upon the verge I found me
422	Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
423	That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
424	Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
425	So that by fixing on its depths my sight
426	Nothing whatever I discerned therein.
427	“Let us descend now into the blind world,”
428	Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
429	“I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”
430	And I, who of his colour was aware,
431	Said: “How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
432	Who’rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?”
433	And he to me: “The anguish of the people
434	Who are below here in my face depicts
435	That pity which for terror thou hast taken.
436	Let us go on, for the long way impels us.”
437	Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
438	The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
439	There, as it seemed to me from listening,
440	Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
441	That tremble made the everlasting air.
442	And this arose from sorrow without torment,
443	Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
444	Of infants and of women and of men.
445	To me the Master good: “Thou dost not ask
446	What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?
447	Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
448	That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
449	’Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
450	Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
451	And if they were before Christianity,
452	In the right manner they adored not God;
453	And among such as these am I myself.
454	For such defects, and not for other guilt,
455	Lost are we and are only so far punished,
456	That without hope we live on in desire.”
457	Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
458	Because some people of much worthiness
459	I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
460	“Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,”
461	Began I, with desire of being certain
462	Of that Faith which o’ercometh every error,
463	“Came any one by his own merit hence,
464	Or by another’s, who was blessed thereafter?”
465	And he, who understood my covert speech,
466	Replied: “I was a novice in this state,
467	When I saw hither come a Mighty One,
468	With sign of victory incoronate.
469	Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,
470	And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
471	Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
472	Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
473	Israel with his father and his children,
474	And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
475	And others many, and he made them blessed;
476	And thou must know, that earlier than these
477	Never were any human spirits saved.”
478	We ceased not to advance because he spake,
479	But still were passing onward through the forest,
480	The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
481	Not very far as yet our way had gone
482	This side the summit, when I saw a fire
483	That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
484	We were a little distant from it still,
485	But not so far that I in part discerned not
486	That honourable people held that place.
487	“O thou who honourest every art and science,
488	Who may these be, which such great honour have,
489	That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?”
490	And he to me: “The honourable name,
491	That sounds of them above there in thy life,
492	Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.”
493	In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
494	“All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
495	His shade returns again, that was departed.”
496	After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
497	Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
498	Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
499	To say to me began my gracious Master:
500	“Him with that falchion in his hand behold,
501	Who comes before the three, even as their lord.
502	That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;
503	He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;
504	The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.
505	Because to each of these with me applies
506	The name that solitary voice proclaimed,
507	They do me honour, and in that do well.”
508	Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
509	Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
510	Who o’er the others like an eagle soars.
511	When they together had discoursed somewhat,
512	They turned to me with signs of salutation,
513	And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
514	And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
515	In that they made me one of their own band;
516	So that the sixth was I, ’mid so much wit.
517	Thus we went on as far as to the light,
518	Things saying ’tis becoming to keep silent,
519	As was the saying of them where I was.
520	We came unto a noble castle’s foot,
521	Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
522	Defended round by a fair rivulet;
523	This we passed over even as firm ground;
524	Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
525	We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
526	People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
527	Of great authority in their countenance;
528	They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
529	Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
530	Into an opening luminous and lofty,
531	So that they all of them were visible.
532	There opposite, upon the green enamel,
533	Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
534	Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
535	I saw Electra with companions many,
536	’Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
537	Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
538	I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
539	On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
540	Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
541	I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
542	Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
543	And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.
544	When I had lifted up my brows a little,
545	The Master I beheld of those who know,
546	Sit with his philosophic family.
547	All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
548	There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
549	Who nearer him before the others stand;
550	Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
551	Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
552	Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
553	Of qualities I saw the good collector,
554	Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
555	Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
556	Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
557	Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
558	Averroes, who the great Comment made.
559	I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
560	Because so drives me onward the long theme,
561	That many times the word comes short of fact.
562	The sixfold company in two divides;
563	Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
564	Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
565	And to a place I come where nothing shines.

=== CANTO 5 ===
566	Thus I descended out of the first circle
567	Down to the second, that less space begirds,
568	And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
569	There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
570	Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
571	Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
572	I say, that when the spirit evil-born
573	Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
574	And this discriminator of transgressions
575	Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
576	Girds himself with his tail as many times
577	As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
578	Always before him many of them stand;
579	They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
580	They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
581	“O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
582	Comest,” said Minos to me, when he saw me,
583	Leaving the practice of so great an office,
584	“Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
585	Let not the portal’s amplitude deceive thee.”
586	And unto him my Guide: “Why criest thou too?
587	Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
588	It is so willed there where is power to do
589	That which is willed; and ask no further question.”
590	And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
591	Audible unto me; now am I come
592	There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
593	I came into a place mute of all light,
594	Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
595	If by opposing winds ’t is combated.
596	The infernal hurricane that never rests
597	Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
598	Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
599	When they arrive before the precipice,
600	There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
601	There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
602	I understood that unto such a torment
603	The carnal malefactors were condemned,
604	Who reason subjugate to appetite.
605	And as the wings of starlings bear them on
606	In the cold season in large band and full,
607	So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
608	It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
609	No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
610	Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
611	And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
612	Making in air a long line of themselves,
613	So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
614	Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
615	Whereupon said I: “Master, who are those
616	People, whom the black air so castigates?”
617	“The first of those, of whom intelligence
618	Thou fain wouldst have,” then said he unto me,
619	“The empress was of many languages.
620	To sensual vices she was so abandoned,
621	That lustful she made licit in her law,
622	To remove the blame to which she had been led.
623	She is Semiramis, of whom we read
624	That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
625	She held the land which now the Sultan rules.
626	The next is she who killed herself for love,
627	And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;
628	Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.”
629	Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
630	Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
631	Who at the last hour combated with Love.
632	Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
633	Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
634	Whom Love had separated from our life.
635	After that I had listened to my Teacher,
636	Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
637	Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
638	And I began: “O Poet, willingly
639	Speak would I to those two, who go together,
640	And seem upon the wind to be so light.”
641	And, he to me: “Thou’lt mark, when they shall be
642	Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
643	By love which leadeth them, and they will come.”
644	Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
645	My voice uplift I: “O ye weary souls!
646	Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.”
647	As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
648	With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
649	Fly through the air by their volition borne,
650	So came they from the band where Dido is,
651	Approaching us athwart the air malign,
652	So strong was the affectionate appeal.
653	“O living creature gracious and benignant,
654	Who visiting goest through the purple air
655	Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
656	If were the King of the Universe our friend,
657	We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
658	Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
659	Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
660	That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
661	While silent is the wind, as it is now.
662	Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
663	Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
664	To rest in peace with all his retinue.
665	Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
666	Seized this man for the person beautiful
667	That was ta’en from me, and still the mode offends me.
668	Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
669	Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
670	That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
671	Love has conducted us unto one death;
672	Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!”
673	These words were borne along from them to us.
674	As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
675	I bowed my face, and so long held it down
676	Until the Poet said to me: “What thinkest?”
677	When I made answer, I began: “Alas!
678	How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
679	Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!”
680	Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
681	And I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,
682	Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
683	But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
684	By what and in what manner Love conceded,
685	That you should know your dubious desires?”
686	And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow
687	Than to be mindful of the happy time
688	In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
689	But, if to recognise the earliest root
690	Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
691	I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
692	One day we reading were for our delight
693	Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
694	Alone we were and without any fear.
695	Full many a time our eyes together drew
696	That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
697	But one point only was it that o’ercame us.
698	When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
699	Being by such a noble lover kissed,
700	This one, who ne’er from me shall be divided,
701	Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
702	Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
703	That day no farther did we read therein.”
704	And all the while one spirit uttered this,
705	The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
706	I swooned away as if I had been dying,
707	And fell, even as a dead body falls.

=== CANTO 6 ===
708	At the return of consciousness, that closed
709	Before the pity of those two relations,
710	Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
711	New torments I behold, and new tormented
712	Around me, whichsoever way I move,
713	And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
714	In the third circle am I of the rain
715	Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
716	Its law and quality are never new.
717	Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
718	Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
719	Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
720	Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
721	With his three gullets like a dog is barking
722	Over the people that are there submerged.
723	Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
724	And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
725	He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
726	Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
727	One side they make a shelter for the other;
728	Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
729	When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
730	His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
731	Not a limb had he that was motionless.
732	And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
733	Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
734	He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
735	Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
736	And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
737	For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
738	The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
739	Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
740	Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
741	We passed across the shadows, which subdues
742	The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
743	Upon their vanity that person seems.
744	They all were lying prone upon the earth,
745	Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
746	As he beheld us passing on before him.
747	“O thou that art conducted through this Hell,”
748	He said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;
749	Thyself wast made before I was unmade.”
750	And I to him: “The anguish which thou hast
751	Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
752	So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
753	But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
754	A place art put, and in such punishment,
755	If some are greater, none is so displeasing.”
756	And he to me: “Thy city, which is full
757	Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
758	Held me within it in the life serene.
759	You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
760	For the pernicious sin of gluttony
761	I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
762	And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
763	For all these suffer the like penalty
764	For the like sin;” and word no more spake he.
765	I answered him: “Ciacco, thy wretchedness
766	Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
767	But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
768	The citizens of the divided city;
769	If any there be just; and the occasion
770	Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.”
771	And he to me: “They, after long contention,
772	Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
773	Will drive the other out with much offence.
774	Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
775	Within three suns, and rise again the other
776	By force of him who now is on the coast.
777	High will it hold its forehead a long while,
778	Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
779	Howe’er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
780	The just are two, and are not understood there;
781	Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
782	Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.”
783	Here ended he his tearful utterance;
784	And I to him: “I wish thee still to teach me,
785	And make a gift to me of further speech.
786	Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
787	Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
788	And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
789	Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
790	For great desire constraineth me to learn
791	If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.”
792	And he: “They are among the blacker souls;
793	A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
794	If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
795	But when thou art again in the sweet world,
796	I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
797	No more I tell thee and no more I answer.”
798	Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
799	Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
800	He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
801	And the Guide said to me: “He wakes no more
802	This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
803	When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
804	Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
805	Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
806	Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.”
807	So we passed onward o’er the filthy mixture
808	Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
809	Touching a little on the future life.
810	Wherefore I said: “Master, these torments here,
811	Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
812	Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?”
813	And he to me: “Return unto thy science,
814	Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,
815	The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.
816	Albeit that this people maledict
817	To true perfection never can attain,
818	Hereafter more than now they look to be.”
819	Round in a circle by that road we went,
820	Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
821	We came unto the point where the descent is;
822	There we found Plutus the great enemy.

=== CANTO 7 ===
823	“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!”
824	Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
825	And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
826	Said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear
827	Harm thee; for any power that he may have
828	Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.”
829	Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
830	And said: “Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
831	Consume within thyself with thine own rage.
832	Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;
833	Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
834	Vengeance upon the proud adultery.”
835	Even as the sails inflated by the wind
836	Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
837	So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
838	Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
839	Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
840	Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
841	Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
842	New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
843	And why doth our transgression waste us so?
844	As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
845	That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
846	So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
847	Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
848	On one side and the other, with great howls,
849	Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
850	They clashed together, and then at that point
851	Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
852	Crying, “Why keepest?” and, “Why squanderest thou?”
853	Thus they returned along the lurid circle
854	On either hand unto the opposite point,
855	Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
856	Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
857	Through his half-circle to another joust;
858	And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
859	Exclaimed: “My Master, now declare to me
860	What people these are, and if all were clerks,
861	These shaven crowns upon the left of us.”
862	And he to me: “All of them were asquint
863	In intellect in the first life, so much
864	That there with measure they no spending made.
865	Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
866	Whene’er they reach the two points of the circle,
867	Where sunders them the opposite defect.
868	Clerks those were who no hairy covering
869	Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,
870	In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.”
871	And I: “My Master, among such as these
872	I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
873	Who were infected with these maladies.”
874	And he to me: “Vain thought thou entertainest;
875	The undiscerning life which made them sordid
876	Now makes them unto all discernment dim.
877	Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
878	These from the sepulchre shall rise again
879	With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.
880	Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
881	Have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;
882	Whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.
883	Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
884	Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
885	For which the human race each other buffet;
886	For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
887	Or ever has been, of these weary souls
888	Could never make a single one repose.”
889	“Master,” I said to him, “now tell me also
890	What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
891	That has the world’s goods so within its clutches?”
892	And he to me: “O creatures imbecile,
893	What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
894	Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.
895	He whose omniscience everything transcends
896	The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
897	That every part to every part may shine,
898	Distributing the light in equal measure;
899	He in like manner to the mundane splendours
900	Ordained a general ministress and guide,
901	That she might change at times the empty treasures
902	From race to race, from one blood to another,
903	Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.
904	Therefore one people triumphs, and another
905	Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,
906	Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.
907	Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;
908	She makes provision, judges, and pursues
909	Her governance, as theirs the other gods.
910	Her permutations have not any truce;
911	Necessity makes her precipitate,
912	So often cometh who his turn obtains.
913	And this is she who is so crucified
914	Even by those who ought to give her praise,
915	Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.
916	But she is blissful, and she hears it not;
917	Among the other primal creatures gladsome
918	She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.
919	Let us descend now unto greater woe;
920	Already sinks each star that was ascending
921	When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.”
922	We crossed the circle to the other bank,
923	Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
924	Along a gully that runs out of it.
925	The water was more sombre far than perse;
926	And we, in company with the dusky waves,
927	Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
928	A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
929	This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
930	Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
931	And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
932	Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
933	All of them naked and with angry look.
934	They smote each other not alone with hands,
935	But with the head and with the breast and feet,
936	Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
937	Said the good Master: “Son, thou now beholdest
938	The souls of those whom anger overcame;
939	And likewise I would have thee know for certain
940	Beneath the water people are who sigh
941	And make this water bubble at the surface,
942	As the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.
943	Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were
944	In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,
945	Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;
946	Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’
947	This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,
948	For with unbroken words they cannot say it.”
949	Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
950	A great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
951	With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
952	Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.

=== CANTO 8 ===
953	I say, continuing, that long before
954	We to the foot of that high tower had come,
955	Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
956	By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
957	And from afar another answer them,
958	So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
959	And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
960	I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth
961	That other fire? and who are they that made it?”
962	And he to me: “Across the turbid waves
963	What is expected thou canst now discern,
964	If reek of the morass conceal it not.”
965	Cord never shot an arrow from itself
966	That sped away athwart the air so swift,
967	As I beheld a very little boat
968	Come o’er the water tow’rds us at that moment,
969	Under the guidance of a single pilot,
970	Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”
971	“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
972	For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us
973	Longer than in the passing of the slough.”
974	As he who listens to some great deceit
975	That has been done to him, and then resents it,
976	Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
977	My Guide descended down into the boat,
978	And then he made me enter after him,
979	And only when I entered seemed it laden.
980	Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
981	The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
982	More of the water than ’tis wont with others.
983	While we were running through the dead canal,
984	Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
985	And said, “Who ’rt thou that comest ere the hour?”
986	And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not;
987	But who art thou that hast become so squalid?”
988	“Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.
989	And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing,
990	Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
991	For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”
992	Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
993	Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
994	Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”
995	Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
996	He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul,
997	Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
998	That was an arrogant person in the world;
999	Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
1000	So likewise here his shade is furious.
1001	How many are esteemed great kings up there,
1002	Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
1003	Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!”
1004	And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased,
1005	If I could see him soused into this broth,
1006	Before we issue forth out of the lake.”
1007	And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore
1008	Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
1009	Such a desire ’tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”
1010	A little after that, I saw such havoc
1011	Made of him by the people of the mire,
1012	That still I praise and thank my God for it.
1013	They all were shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”
1014	And that exasperate spirit Florentine
1015	Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
1016	We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
1017	But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
1018	Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
1019	And the good Master said: “Even now, my Son,
1020	The city draweth near whose name is Dis,
1021	With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”
1022	And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly
1023	Within there in the valley I discern
1024	Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
1025	They were.” And he to me: “The fire eternal
1026	That kindles them within makes them look red,
1027	As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.”
1028	Then we arrived within the moats profound,
1029	That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
1030	The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
1031	Not without making first a circuit wide,
1032	We came unto a place where loud the pilot
1033	Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”
1034	More than a thousand at the gates I saw
1035	Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
1036	Were saying, “Who is this that without death
1037	Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?”
1038	And my sagacious Master made a sign
1039	Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
1040	A little then they quelled their great disdain,
1041	And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone
1042	Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
1043	Let him return alone by his mad road;
1044	Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
1045	Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.”
1046	Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
1047	At utterance of the accursed words;
1048	For never to return here I believed.
1049	“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
1050	Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
1051	From imminent peril that before me stood,
1052	Do not desert me,” said I, “thus undone;
1053	And if the going farther be denied us,
1054	Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.”
1055	And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
1056	Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage
1057	None can take from us, it by Such is given.
1058	But here await me, and thy weary spirit
1059	Comfort and nourish with a better hope;
1060	For in this nether world I will not leave thee.”
1061	So onward goes and there abandons me
1062	My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
1063	For No and Yes within my head contend.
1064	I could not hear what he proposed to them;
1065	But with them there he did not linger long,
1066	Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
1067	They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
1068	On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without
1069	And turned to me with footsteps far between.
1070	His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
1071	Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
1072	“Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”
1073	And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry,
1074	Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,
1075	Whatever for defence within be planned.
1076	This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
1077	For once they used it at less secret gate,
1078	Which finds itself without a fastening still.
1079	O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;
1080	And now this side of it descends the steep,
1081	Passing across the circles without escort,
1082	One by whose means the city shall be opened.”

=== CANTO 9 ===
1083	That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
1084	Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
1085	Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
1086	He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
1087	Because the eye could not conduct him far
1088	Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
1089	“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,”
1090	Began he; “Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
1091	O how I long that some one here arrive!”
1092	Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
1093	He covered up with what came afterward,
1094	That they were words quite different from the first;
1095	But none the less his saying gave me fear,
1096	Because I carried out the broken phrase,
1097	Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
1098	“Into this bottom of the doleful conch
1099	Doth any e’er descend from the first grade,
1100	Which for its pain has only hope cut off?”
1101	This question put I; and he answered me:
1102	“Seldom it comes to pass that one of us
1103	Maketh the journey upon which I go.
1104	True is it, once before I here below
1105	Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,
1106	Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.
1107	Naked of me short while the flesh had been,
1108	Before within that wall she made me enter,
1109	To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;
1110	That is the lowest region and the darkest,
1111	And farthest from the heaven which circles all.
1112	Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.
1113	This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,
1114	Encompasses about the city dolent,
1115	Where now we cannot enter without anger.”
1116	And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
1117	Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
1118	Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
1119	Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
1120	The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
1121	Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
1122	And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
1123	Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
1124	Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
1125	And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
1126	Of everlasting lamentation knew,
1127	Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.
1128	This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;
1129	She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;
1130	Tisiphone is between;” and then was silent.
1131	Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
1132	They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
1133	That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
1134	“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!”
1135	All shouted looking down; “in evil hour
1136	Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”
1137	“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,
1138	For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,
1139	No more returning upward would there be.”
1140	Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
1141	Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
1142	So far as not to blind me with his own.
1143	O ye who have undistempered intellects,
1144	Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
1145	Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
1146	And now there came across the turbid waves
1147	The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
1148	Because of which both of the margins trembled;
1149	Not otherwise it was than of a wind
1150	Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
1151	That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
1152	The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
1153	Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
1154	And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
1155	Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve
1156	Of vision now along that ancient foam,
1157	There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”
1158	Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
1159	Across the water scatter all abroad,
1160	Until each one is huddled in the earth.
1161	More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
1162	Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
1163	Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.
1164	From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
1165	Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
1166	And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
1167	Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
1168	And to the Master turned; and he made sign
1169	That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
1170	Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
1171	He reached the gate, and with a little rod
1172	He opened it, for there was no resistance.
1173	“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!”
1174	Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
1175	“Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
1176	Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,
1177	From which the end can never be cut off,
1178	And which has many times increased your pain?
1179	What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
1180	Your Cerberus, if you remember well,
1181	For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”
1182	Then he returned along the miry road,
1183	And spake no word to us, but had the look
1184	Of one whom other care constrains and goads
1185	Than that of him who in his presence is;
1186	And we our feet directed tow’rds the city,
1187	After those holy words all confident.
1188	Within we entered without any contest;
1189	And I, who inclination had to see
1190	What the condition such a fortress holds,
1191	Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
1192	And see on every hand an ample plain,
1193	Full of distress and torment terrible.
1194	Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
1195	Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
1196	That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
1197	The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
1198	So likewise did they there on every side,
1199	Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
1200	For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
1201	By which they so intensely heated were,
1202	That iron more so asks not any art.
1203	All of their coverings uplifted were,
1204	And from them issued forth such dire laments,
1205	Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
1206	And I: “My Master, what are all those people
1207	Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
1208	Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”
1209	And he to me: “Here are the Heresiarchs,
1210	With their disciples of all sects, and much
1211	More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.
1212	Here like together with its like is buried;
1213	And more and less the monuments are heated.”
1214	And when he to the right had turned, we passed
1215	Between the torments and high parapets.

=== CANTO 10 ===
1216	Now onward goes, along a narrow path
1217	Between the torments and the city wall,
1218	My Master, and I follow at his back.
1219	“O power supreme, that through these impious circles
1220	Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee,
1221	Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
1222	The people who are lying in these tombs,
1223	Might they be seen? already are uplifted
1224	The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”
1225	And he to me: “They all will be closed up
1226	When from Jehoshaphat they shall return
1227	Here with the bodies they have left above.
1228	Their cemetery have upon this side
1229	With Epicurus all his followers,
1230	Who with the body mortal make the soul;
1231	But in the question thou dost put to me,
1232	Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,
1233	And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”
1234	And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed
1235	From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
1236	Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”
1237	“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire
1238	Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,
1239	Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.
1240	Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
1241	A native of that noble fatherland,
1242	To which perhaps I too molestful was.”
1243	Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
1244	From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
1245	Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
1246	And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?
1247	Behold there Farinata who has risen;
1248	From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”
1249	I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
1250	And he uprose erect with breast and front
1251	E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.
1252	And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
1253	Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
1254	Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”
1255	As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
1256	Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
1257	Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”
1258	I, who desirous of obeying was,
1259	Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
1260	Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
1261	Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been
1262	To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
1263	So that two several times I scattered them.”
1264	“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”
1265	I answered him, “the first time and the second;
1266	But yours have not acquired that art aright.”
1267	Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
1268	Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
1269	I think that he had risen on his knees.
1270	Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
1271	He had to see if some one else were with me,
1272	But after his suspicion was all spent,
1273	Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind
1274	Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
1275	Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”
1276	And I to him: “I come not of myself;
1277	He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
1278	Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”
1279	His language and the mode of punishment
1280	Already unto me had read his name;
1281	On that account my answer was so full.
1282	Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How
1283	Saidst thou,—he had? Is he not still alive?
1284	Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”
1285	When he became aware of some delay,
1286	Which I before my answer made, supine
1287	He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
1288	But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
1289	I had remained, did not his aspect change,
1290	Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
1291	“And if,” continuing his first discourse,
1292	“They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,
1293	That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
1294	But fifty times shall not rekindled be
1295	The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
1296	Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
1297	And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
1298	Say why that people is so pitiless
1299	Against my race in each one of its laws?”
1300	Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage
1301	Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
1302	Such orisons in our temple to be made.”
1303	After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
1304	“There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely
1305	Without a cause had with the others moved.
1306	But there I was alone, where every one
1307	Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
1308	He who defended her with open face.”
1309	“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”
1310	I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,
1311	Which has entangled my conceptions here.
1312	It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
1313	Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,
1314	And in the present have another mode.”
1315	“We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
1316	The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;
1317	So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
1318	When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
1319	Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
1320	Not anything know we of your human state.
1321	Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
1322	Will be our knowledge from the moment when
1323	The portal of the future shall be closed.”
1324	Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
1325	Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
1326	That still his son is with the living joined.
1327	And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
1328	Tell him I did it because I was thinking
1329	Already of the error you have solved me.”
1330	And now my Master was recalling me,
1331	Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
1332	That he would tell me who was with him there.
1333	He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;
1334	Within here is the second Frederick,
1335	And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”
1336	Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
1337	The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
1338	Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
1339	He moved along; and afterward thus going,
1340	He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”
1341	And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
1342	“Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
1343	Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,
1344	“And now attend here;” and he raised his finger.
1345	“When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
1346	Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
1347	From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”
1348	Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
1349	We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
1350	Along a path that strikes into a valley,
1351	Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.

=== CANTO 11 ===
1352	Upon the margin of a lofty bank
1353	Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
1354	We came upon a still more cruel throng;
1355	And there, by reason of the horrible
1356	Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
1357	We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
1358	Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
1359	Which said: “Pope Anastasius I hold,
1360	Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”
1361	“Slow it behoveth our descent to be,
1362	So that the sense be first a little used
1363	To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.”
1364	The Master thus; and unto him I said,
1365	“Some compensation find, that the time pass not
1366	Idly;” and he: “Thou seest I think of that.
1367	My son, upon the inside of these rocks,”
1368	Began he then to say, “are three small circles,
1369	From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.
1370	They all are full of spirits maledict;
1371	But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
1372	Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.
1373	Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,
1374	Injury is the end; and all such end
1375	Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.
1376	But because fraud is man’s peculiar vice,
1377	More it displeases God; and so stand lowest
1378	The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.
1379	All the first circle of the Violent is;
1380	But since force may be used against three persons,
1381	In three rounds ’tis divided and constructed.
1382	To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we
1383	Use force; I say on them and on their things,
1384	As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.
1385	A death by violence, and painful wounds,
1386	Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
1387	Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;
1388	Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,
1389	Marauders, and freebooters, the first round
1390	Tormenteth all in companies diverse.
1391	Man may lay violent hands upon himself
1392	And his own goods; and therefore in the second
1393	Round must perforce without avail repent
1394	Whoever of your world deprives himself,
1395	Who games, and dissipates his property,
1396	And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.
1397	Violence can be done the Deity,
1398	In heart denying and blaspheming Him,
1399	And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.
1400	And for this reason doth the smallest round
1401	Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,
1402	And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.
1403	Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,
1404	A man may practise upon him who trusts,
1405	And him who doth no confidence imburse.
1406	This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
1407	Only the bond of love which Nature makes;
1408	Wherefore within the second circle nestle
1409	Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,
1410	Falsification, theft, and simony,
1411	Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
1412	By the other mode, forgotten is that love
1413	Which Nature makes, and what is after added,
1414	From which there is a special faith engendered.
1415	Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is
1416	Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,
1417	Whoe’er betrays for ever is consumed.”
1418	And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds
1419	Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
1420	This cavern and the people who possess it.
1421	But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
1422	Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
1423	And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
1424	Wherefore are they inside of the red city
1425	Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
1426	And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”
1427	And unto me he said: “Why wanders so
1428	Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
1429	Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
1430	Hast thou no recollection of those words
1431	With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
1432	The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,—
1433	Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
1434	Bestiality? and how Incontinence
1435	Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?
1436	If thou regardest this conclusion well,
1437	And to thy mind recallest who they are
1438	That up outside are undergoing penance,
1439	Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
1440	They separated are, and why less wroth
1441	Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.”
1442	“O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,
1443	Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,
1444	That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!
1445	Once more a little backward turn thee,” said I,
1446	“There where thou sayest that usury offends
1447	Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”
1448	“Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,
1449	Noteth, not only in one place alone,
1450	After what manner Nature takes her course
1451	From Intellect Divine, and from its art;
1452	And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,
1453	After not many pages shalt thou find,
1454	That this your art as far as possible
1455	Follows, as the disciple doth the master;
1456	So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.
1457	From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind
1458	Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
1459	Mankind to gain their life and to advance;
1460	And since the usurer takes another way,
1461	Nature herself and in her follower
1462	Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.
1463	But follow, now, as I would fain go on,
1464	For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,
1465	And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,
1466	And far beyond there we descend the crag.”

=== CANTO 12 ===
1467	The place where to descend the bank we came
1468	Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
1469	Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
1470	Such as that ruin is which in the flank
1471	Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
1472	Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
1473	For from the mountain’s top, from which it moved,
1474	Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
1475	Some path ’twould give to him who was above;
1476	Even such was the descent of that ravine,
1477	And on the border of the broken chasm
1478	The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
1479	Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
1480	And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
1481	Even as one whom anger racks within.
1482	My Sage towards him shouted: “Peradventure
1483	Thou think’st that here may be the Duke of Athens,
1484	Who in the world above brought death to thee?
1485	Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not
1486	Instructed by thy sister, but he comes
1487	In order to behold your punishments.”
1488	As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
1489	In which he has received the mortal blow,
1490	Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,
1491	The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
1492	And he, the wary, cried: “Run to the passage;
1493	While he wroth, ’tis well thou shouldst descend.”
1494	Thus down we took our way o’er that discharge
1495	Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
1496	Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
1497	Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking
1498	Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
1499	By that brute anger which just now I quenched.
1500	Now will I have thee know, the other time
1501	I here descended to the nether Hell,
1502	This precipice had not yet fallen down.
1503	But truly, if I well discern, a little
1504	Before His coming who the mighty spoil
1505	Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,
1506	Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
1507	Trembled so, that I thought the Universe
1508	Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
1509	The world ofttimes converted into chaos;
1510	And at that moment this primeval crag
1511	Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.
1512	But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
1513	The river of blood, within which boiling is
1514	Whoe’er by violence doth injure others.”
1515	O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
1516	That spurs us onward so in our short life,
1517	And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
1518	I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
1519	As one which all the plain encompasses,
1520	Conformable to what my Guide had said.
1521	And between this and the embankment’s foot
1522	Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
1523	As in the world they used the chase to follow.
1524	Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
1525	And from the squadron three detached themselves,
1526	With bows and arrows in advance selected;
1527	And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment
1528	Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
1529	Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”
1530	My Master said: “Our answer will we make
1531	To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,
1532	That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”
1533	Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,
1534	Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,
1535	And for himself, himself did vengeance take.
1536	And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,
1537	Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;
1538	That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.
1539	Thousands and thousands go about the moat
1540	Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
1541	Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”
1542	Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
1543	Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
1544	Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
1545	After he had uncovered his great mouth,
1546	He said to his companions: “Are you ware
1547	That he behind moveth whate’er he touches?
1548	Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”
1549	And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
1550	Where the two natures are together joined,
1551	Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone
1552	Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;
1553	Necessity, and not delight, impels us.
1554	Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,
1555	Who unto me committed this new office;
1556	No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.
1557	But by that virtue through which I am moving
1558	My steps along this savage thoroughfare,
1559	Give us some one of thine, to be with us,
1560	And who may show us where to pass the ford,
1561	And who may carry this one on his back;
1562	For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”
1563	Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
1564	And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,
1565	And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”
1566	We with our faithful escort onward moved
1567	Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
1568	Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.
1569	People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
1570	And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,
1571	Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
1572	Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
1573	Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
1574	Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
1575	That forehead there which has the hair so black
1576	Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
1577	Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
1578	Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”
1579	Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
1580	“Now he be first to thee, and second I.”
1581	A little farther on the Centaur stopped
1582	Above a folk, who far down as the throat
1583	Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.
1584	A shade he showed us on one side alone,
1585	Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom
1586	The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.”
1587	Then people saw I, who from out the river
1588	Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
1589	And many among these I recognised.
1590	Thus ever more and more grew shallower
1591	That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
1592	And there across the moat our passage was.
1593	“Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
1594	The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”
1595	The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe
1596	That on this other more and more declines
1597	Its bed, until it reunites itself
1598	Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
1599	Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
1600	That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,
1601	And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks
1602	The tears which with the boiling it unseals
1603	In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
1604	Who made upon the highways so much war.”
1605	Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.

=== CANTO 13 ===
1606	Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
1607	When we had put ourselves within a wood,
1608	That was not marked by any path whatever.
1609	Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,
1610	Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,
1611	Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.
1612	Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,
1613	Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
1614	’Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.
1615	There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,
1616	Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,
1617	With sad announcement of impending doom;
1618	Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,
1619	And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;
1620	They make laments upon the wondrous trees.
1621	And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,
1622	Know that thou art within the second round,”
1623	Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till
1624	Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;
1625	Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see
1626	Things that will credence give unto my speech.”
1627	I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,
1628	And person none beheld I who might make them,
1629	Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
1630	I think he thought that I perhaps might think
1631	So many voices issued through those trunks
1632	From people who concealed themselves from us;
1633	Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off
1634	Some little spray from any of these trees,
1635	The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”
1636	Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
1637	And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
1638	And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”
1639	After it had become embrowned with blood,
1640	It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?
1641	Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
1642	Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;
1643	Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
1644	Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”
1645	As out of a green brand, that is on fire
1646	At one of the ends, and from the other drips
1647	And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
1648	So from that splinter issued forth together
1649	Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
1650	Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
1651	“Had he been able sooner to believe,”
1652	My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,
1653	What only in my verses he has seen,
1654	Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;
1655	Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
1656	To put him to an act which grieveth me.
1657	But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
1658	Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
1659	Up in the world, to which he can return.”
1660	And the trunk said: “So thy sweet words allure me,
1661	I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
1662	That I a little to discourse am tempted.
1663	I am the one who both keys had in keeping
1664	Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro
1665	So softly in unlocking and in locking,
1666	That from his secrets most men I withheld;
1667	Fidelity I bore the glorious office
1668	So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
1669	The courtesan who never from the dwelling
1670	Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
1671	Death universal and the vice of courts,
1672	Inflamed against me all the other minds,
1673	And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
1674	That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
1675	My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
1676	Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
1677	Made me unjust against myself, the just.
1678	I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
1679	Do swear to you that never broke I faith
1680	Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
1681	And to the world if one of you return,
1682	Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
1683	Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”
1684	Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”
1685	The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,
1686	But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”
1687	Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire
1688	Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;
1689	For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.”
1690	Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man
1691	Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
1692	Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
1693	To tell us in what way the soul is bound
1694	Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
1695	If any from such members e’er is freed.”
1696	Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
1697	The wind was into such a voice converted:
1698	“With brevity shall be replied to you.
1699	When the exasperated soul abandons
1700	The body whence it rent itself away,
1701	Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
1702	It falls into the forest, and no part
1703	Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
1704	There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
1705	It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
1706	The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
1707	Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
1708	Like others for our spoils shall we return;
1709	But not that any one may them revest,
1710	For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.
1711	Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
1712	Forest our bodies shall suspended be,
1713	Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”
1714	We were attentive still unto the trunk,
1715	Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
1716	When by a tumult we were overtaken,
1717	In the same way as he is who perceives
1718	The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
1719	Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
1720	And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
1721	Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
1722	That of the forest, every fan they broke.
1723	He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”
1724	And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
1725	Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert
1726	Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”
1727	And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
1728	He grouped himself together with a bush.
1729	Behind them was the forest full of black
1730	She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
1731	As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
1732	On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,
1733	And him they lacerated piece by piece,
1734	Thereafter bore away those aching members.
1735	Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
1736	And led me to the bush, that all in vain
1737	Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.
1738	“O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,
1739	What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
1740	What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”
1741	When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
1742	He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
1743	Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”
1744	And he to us: “O souls, that hither come
1745	To look upon the shameful massacre
1746	That has so rent away from me my leaves,
1747	Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
1748	I of that city was which to the Baptist
1749	Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
1750	Forever with his art will make it sad.
1751	And were it not that on the pass of Arno
1752	Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
1753	Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
1754	Upon the ashes left by Attila,
1755	In vain had caused their labour to be done.
1756	Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”

=== CANTO 14 ===
1757	Because the charity of my native place
1758	Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
1759	And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
1760	Then came we to the confine, where disparted
1761	The second round is from the third, and where
1762	A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
1763	Clearly to manifest these novel things,
1764	I say that we arrived upon a plain,
1765	Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
1766	The dolorous forest is a garland to it
1767	All round about, as the sad moat to that;
1768	There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
1769	The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
1770	Not of another fashion made than that
1771	Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
1772	Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
1773	By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
1774	That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
1775	Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
1776	Who all were weeping very miserably,
1777	And over them seemed set a law diverse.
1778	Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
1779	And some were sitting all drawn up together,
1780	And others went about continually.
1781	Those who were going round were far the more,
1782	And those were less who lay down to their torment,
1783	But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.
1784	O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
1785	Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,
1786	As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
1787	As Alexander, in those torrid parts
1788	Of India, beheld upon his host
1789	Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
1790	Whence he provided with his phalanxes
1791	To trample down the soil, because the vapour
1792	Better extinguished was while it was single;
1793	Thus was descending the eternal heat,
1794	Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
1795	Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
1796	Without repose forever was the dance
1797	Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
1798	Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
1799	“Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest
1800	All things except the demons dire, that issued
1801	Against us at the entrance of the gate,
1802	Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
1803	The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
1804	So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”
1805	And he himself, who had become aware
1806	That I was questioning my Guide about him,
1807	Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead.
1808	If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
1809	He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
1810	Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
1811	And if he wearied out by turns the others
1812	In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
1813	Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’
1814	Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
1815	And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
1816	He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”
1817	Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
1818	That I had never heard him speak so loud:
1819	“O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished
1820	Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;
1821	Not any torment, saving thine own rage,
1822	Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”
1823	Then he turned round to me with better lip,
1824	Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he
1825	Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold
1826	God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;
1827	But, as I said to him, his own despites
1828	Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.
1829	Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
1830	As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,
1831	But always keep them close unto the wood.”
1832	Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
1833	Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
1834	Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
1835	As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
1836	The sinful women later share among them,
1837	So downward through the sand it went its way.
1838	The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
1839	Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
1840	Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
1841	“In all the rest which I have shown to thee
1842	Since we have entered in within the gate
1843	Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
1844	Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
1845	So notable as is the present river,
1846	Which all the little flames above it quenches.”
1847	These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
1848	That he would give me largess of the food,
1849	For which he had given me largess of desire.
1850	“In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”
1851	Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,
1852	Under whose king the world of old was chaste.
1853	There is a mountain there, that once was glad
1854	With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;
1855	Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.
1856	Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
1857	Of her own son; and to conceal him better,
1858	Whene’er he cried, she there had clamours made.
1859	A grand old man stands in the mount erect,
1860	Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,
1861	And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.
1862	His head is fashioned of refined gold,
1863	And of pure silver are the arms and breast;
1864	Then he is brass as far down as the fork.
1865	From that point downward all is chosen iron,
1866	Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,
1867	And more he stands on that than on the other.
1868	Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
1869	Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
1870	Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
1871	From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
1872	Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
1873	Then downward go along this narrow sluice
1874	Unto that point where is no more descending.
1875	They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
1876	Thou shalt behold, so here ’tis not narrated.”
1877	And I to him: “If so the present runnel
1878	Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
1879	Why only on this verge appears it to us?”
1880	And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round,
1881	And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,
1882	Still to the left descending to the bottom,
1883	Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.
1884	Therefore if something new appear to us,
1885	It should not bring amazement to thy face.”
1886	And I again: “Master, where shall be found
1887	Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou’rt silent,
1888	And sayest the other of this rain is made?”
1889	“In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,”
1890	Replied he; “but the boiling of the red
1891	Water might well solve one of them thou makest.
1892	Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,
1893	There where the souls repair to lave themselves,
1894	When sin repented of has been removed.”
1895	Then said he: “It is time now to abandon
1896	The wood; take heed that thou come after me;
1897	A way the margins make that are not burning,
1898	And over them all vapours are extinguished.”

=== CANTO 15 ===
1899	Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
1900	And so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it,
1901	From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
1902	Even as the Flemings, ’twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
1903	Fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself,
1904	Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
1905	And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
1906	To guard their villas and their villages,
1907	Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
1908	In such similitude had those been made,
1909	Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
1910	Whoever he might be, the master made them.
1911	Now were we from the forest so remote,
1912	I could not have discovered where it was,
1913	Even if backward I had turned myself,
1914	When we a company of souls encountered,
1915	Who came beside the dike, and every one
1916	Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
1917	To eye each other under a new moon,
1918	And so towards us sharpened they their brows
1919	As an old tailor at the needle’s eye.
1920	Thus scrutinised by such a family,
1921	By some one I was recognised, who seized
1922	My garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”
1923	And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
1924	On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
1925	That the scorched countenance prevented not
1926	His recognition by my intellect;
1927	And bowing down my face unto his own,
1928	I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”
1929	And he: “May’t not displease thee, O my son,
1930	If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
1931	Backward return and let the trail go on.”
1932	I said to him: “With all my power I ask it;
1933	And if you wish me to sit down with you,
1934	I will, if he please, for I go with him.”
1935	“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd
1936	A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,
1937	Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
1938	Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
1939	And afterward will I rejoin my band,
1940	Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”
1941	I did not dare to go down from the road
1942	Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
1943	I held as one who goeth reverently.
1944	And he began: “What fortune or what fate
1945	Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
1946	And who is this that showeth thee the way?”
1947	“Up there above us in the life serene,”
1948	I answered him, “I lost me in a valley,
1949	Or ever yet my age had been completed.
1950	But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
1951	This one appeared to me, returning thither,
1952	And homeward leadeth me along this road.”
1953	And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow,
1954	Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
1955	If well I judged in the life beautiful.
1956	And if I had not died so prematurely,
1957	Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
1958	I would have given thee comfort in the work.
1959	But that ungrateful and malignant people,
1960	Which of old time from Fesole descended,
1961	And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
1962	Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
1963	And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
1964	It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
1965	Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
1966	A people avaricious, envious, proud;
1967	Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
1968	Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
1969	One party and the other shall be hungry
1970	For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
1971	Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
1972	Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
1973	If any still upon their dunghill rise,
1974	In which may yet revive the consecrated
1975	Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
1976	The nest of such great malice it became.”
1977	“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,”
1978	Replied I to him, “not yet would you be
1979	In banishment from human nature placed;
1980	For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
1981	My heart the dear and good paternal image
1982	Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
1983	You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
1984	And how much I am grateful, while I live
1985	Behoves that in my language be discerned.
1986	What you narrate of my career I write,
1987	And keep it to be glossed with other text
1988	By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
1989	This much will I have manifest to you;
1990	Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
1991	For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
1992	Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
1993	Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
1994	As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.”
1995	My Master thereupon on his right cheek
1996	Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
1997	Then said: “He listeneth well who noteth it.”
1998	Nor speaking less on that account, I go
1999	With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
2000	His most known and most eminent companions.
2001	And he to me: “To know of some is well;
2002	Of others it were laudable to be silent,
2003	For short would be the time for so much speech.
2004	Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
2005	And men of letters great and of great fame,
2006	In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
2007	Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
2008	And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
2009	If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
2010	That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
2011	From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
2012	Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
2013	More would I say, but coming and discoursing
2014	Can be no longer; for that I behold
2015	New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
2016	A people comes with whom I may not be;
2017	Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
2018	In which I still live, and no more I ask.”
2019	Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
2020	Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
2021	Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
2022	The one who wins, and not the one who loses.

=== CANTO 16 ===
2023	Now was I where was heard the reverberation
2024	Of water falling into the next round,
2025	Like to that humming which the beehives make,
2026	When shadows three together started forth,
2027	Running, from out a company that passed
2028	Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
2029	Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
2030	“Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
2031	To be some one of our depraved city.”
2032	Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
2033	Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
2034	It pains me still but to remember it.
2035	Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
2036	He turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,”
2037	He said; “to these we should be courteous.
2038	And if it were not for the fire that darts
2039	The nature of this region, I should say
2040	That haste were more becoming thee than them.”
2041	As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
2042	The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
2043	Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
2044	As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
2045	Watching for their advantage and their hold,
2046	Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
2047	Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
2048	Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
2049	His neck and feet continual journey made.
2050	And, “If the misery of this soft place
2051	Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,”
2052	Began one, “and our aspect black and blistered,
2053	Let the renown of us thy mind incline
2054	To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
2055	Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
2056	He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
2057	Naked and skinless though he now may go,
2058	Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
2059	He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
2060	His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
2061	Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
2062	The other, who close by me treads the sand,
2063	Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
2064	Above there in the world should welcome be.
2065	And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
2066	Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
2067	My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.”
2068	Could I have been protected from the fire,
2069	Below I should have thrown myself among them,
2070	And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
2071	But as I should have burned and baked myself,
2072	My terror overmastered my good will,
2073	Which made me greedy of embracing them.
2074	Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain
2075	Did your condition fix within me so,
2076	That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
2077	As soon as this my Lord said unto me
2078	Words, on account of which I thought within me
2079	That people such as you are were approaching.
2080	I of your city am; and evermore
2081	Your labours and your honourable names
2082	I with affection have retraced and heard.
2083	I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
2084	Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
2085	But to the centre first I needs must plunge.”
2086	“So may the soul for a long while conduct
2087	Those limbs of thine,” did he make answer then,
2088	“And so may thy renown shine after thee,
2089	Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
2090	Within our city, as they used to do,
2091	Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
2092	For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
2093	With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
2094	Doth greatly mortify us with his words.”
2095	“The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
2096	Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
2097	Florence, so that thou weep’st thereat already!”
2098	In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
2099	And the three, taking that for my reply,
2100	Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
2101	“If other times so little it doth cost thee,”
2102	Replied they all, “to satisfy another,
2103	Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
2104	Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
2105	And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
2106	When it shall pleasure thee to say, ‘I was,’
2107	See that thou speak of us unto the people.”
2108	Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
2109	It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
2110	Not an Amen could possibly be said
2111	So rapidly as they had disappeared;
2112	Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
2113	I followed him, and little had we gone,
2114	Before the sound of water was so near us,
2115	That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
2116	Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
2117	The first from Monte Veso tow’rds the East,
2118	Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
2119	Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
2120	It down descendeth into its low bed,
2121	And at Forli is vacant of that name,
2122	Reverberates there above San Benedetto
2123	From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
2124	Where for a thousand there were room enough;
2125	Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
2126	We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
2127	So that it soon the ear would have offended.
2128	I had a cord around about me girt,
2129	And therewithal I whilom had designed
2130	To take the panther with the painted skin.
2131	After I this had all from me unloosed,
2132	As my Conductor had commanded me,
2133	I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
2134	Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
2135	And at a little distance from the verge,
2136	He cast it down into that deep abyss.
2137	“It must needs be some novelty respond,”
2138	I said within myself, “to the new signal
2139	The Master with his eye is following so.”
2140	Ah me! how very cautious men should be
2141	With those who not alone behold the act,
2142	But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
2143	He said to me: “Soon there will upward come
2144	What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
2145	Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.”
2146	Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
2147	A man should close his lips as far as may be,
2148	Because without his fault it causes shame;
2149	But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
2150	Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
2151	So may they not be void of lasting favour,
2152	Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
2153	I saw a figure swimming upward come,
2154	Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
2155	Even as he returns who goeth down
2156	Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
2157	Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
2158	Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.

=== CANTO 17 ===
2159	“Behold the monster with the pointed tail,
2160	Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,
2161	Behold him who infecteth all the world.”
2162	Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
2163	And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
2164	Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
2165	And that uncleanly image of deceit
2166	Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
2167	But on the border did not drag its tail.
2168	The face was as the face of a just man,
2169	Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
2170	And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
2171	Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
2172	The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
2173	Depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.
2174	With colours more, groundwork or broidery
2175	Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
2176	Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
2177	As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
2178	That part are in the water, part on land;
2179	And as among the guzzling Germans there,
2180	The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
2181	So that vile monster lay upon the border,
2182	Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
2183	His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
2184	Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
2185	That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
2186	The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside
2187	Our way a little, even to that beast
2188	Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”
2189	We therefore on the right side descended,
2190	And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
2191	Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
2192	And after we are come to him, I see
2193	A little farther off upon the sand
2194	A people sitting near the hollow place.
2195	Then said to me the Master: “So that full
2196	Experience of this round thou bear away,
2197	Now go and see what their condition is.
2198	There let thy conversation be concise;
2199	Till thou returnest I will speak with him,
2200	That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”
2201	Thus farther still upon the outermost
2202	Head of that seventh circle all alone
2203	I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
2204	Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
2205	This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
2206	Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
2207	Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
2208	Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
2209	By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.
2210	When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
2211	Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,
2212	Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
2213	That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
2214	Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
2215	And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
2216	And as I gazing round me come among them,
2217	Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
2218	That had the face and posture of a lion.
2219	Proceeding then the current of my sight,
2220	Another of them saw I, red as blood,
2221	Display a goose more white than butter is.
2222	And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
2223	Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
2224	Said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?
2225	Now get thee gone; and since thou’rt still alive,
2226	Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
2227	Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
2228	A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
2229	Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
2230	Exclaiming, ‘Come the sovereign cavalier,
2231	He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;’”
2232	Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
2233	His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
2234	And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
2235	Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
2236	Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
2237	I found my Guide, who had already mounted
2238	Upon the back of that wild animal,
2239	And said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.
2240	Now we descend by stairways such as these;
2241	Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,
2242	So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”
2243	Such as he is who has so near the ague
2244	Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
2245	And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
2246	Even such became I at those proffered words;
2247	But shame in me his menaces produced,
2248	Which maketh servant strong before good master.
2249	I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
2250	I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
2251	As I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”
2252	But he, who other times had rescued me
2253	In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
2254	Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
2255	And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
2256	The circles large, and the descent be little;
2257	Think of the novel burden which thou hast.”
2258	Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
2259	Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
2260	And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
2261	There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
2262	And that extended like an eel he moved,
2263	And with his paws drew to himself the air.
2264	A greater fear I do not think there was
2265	What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
2266	Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
2267	Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
2268	Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
2269	His father crying, “An ill way thou takest!”
2270	Than was my own, when I perceived myself
2271	On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
2272	The sight of everything but of the monster.
2273	Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
2274	Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
2275	By wind upon my face and from below.
2276	I heard already on the right the whirlpool
2277	Making a horrible crashing under us;
2278	Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
2279	Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
2280	Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
2281	Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
2282	I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
2283	The turning and descending, by great horrors
2284	That were approaching upon divers sides.
2285	As falcon who has long been on the wing,
2286	Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
2287	Maketh the falconer say, “Ah me, thou stoopest,”
2288	Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
2289	Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
2290	Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
2291	Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
2292	Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
2293	And being disencumbered of our persons,
2294	He sped away as arrow from the string.

=== CANTO 18 ===
2295	There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,
2296	Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,
2297	As is the circle that around it turns.
2298	Right in the middle of the field malign
2299	There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
2300	Of which its place the structure will recount.
2301	Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
2302	Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
2303	And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
2304	As where for the protection of the walls
2305	Many and many moats surround the castles,
2306	The part in which they are a figure forms,
2307	Just such an image those presented there;
2308	And as about such strongholds from their gates
2309	Unto the outer bank are little bridges,
2310	So from the precipice’s base did crags
2311	Project, which intersected dikes and moats,
2312	Unto the well that truncates and collects them.
2313	Within this place, down shaken from the back
2314	Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet
2315	Held to the left, and I moved on behind.
2316	Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,
2317	New torments, and new wielders of the lash,
2318	Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.
2319	Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;
2320	This side the middle came they facing us,
2321	Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;
2322	Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,
2323	The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,
2324	Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;
2325	For all upon one side towards the Castle
2326	Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter’s;
2327	On the other side they go towards the Mountain.
2328	This side and that, along the livid stone
2329	Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
2330	Who cruelly were beating them behind.
2331	Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
2332	At the first blows! and sooth not any one
2333	The second waited for, nor for the third.
2334	While I was going on, mine eyes by one
2335	Encountered were; and straight I said: “Already
2336	With sight of this one I am not unfed.”
2337	Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
2338	And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
2339	And to my going somewhat back assented;
2340	And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
2341	Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
2342	For said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,
2343	If false are not the features which thou bearest,
2344	Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
2345	But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?”
2346	And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;
2347	But forces me thine utterance distinct,
2348	Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
2349	I was the one who the fair Ghisola
2350	Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
2351	Howe’er the shameless story may be told.
2352	Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
2353	Nay, rather is this place so full of them,
2354	That not so many tongues to-day are taught
2355	’Twixt Reno and Savena to say ‘sipa;’
2356	And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,
2357	Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.”
2358	While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
2359	A demon smote him, and said: “Get thee gone
2360	Pander, there are no women here for coin.”
2361	I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
2362	Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
2363	To where a crag projected from the bank.
2364	This very easily did we ascend,
2365	And turning to the right along its ridge,
2366	From those eternal circles we departed.
2367	When we were there, where it is hollowed out
2368	Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
2369	The Guide said: “Wait, and see that on thee strike
2370	The vision of those others evil-born,
2371	Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,
2372	Because together with us they have gone.”
2373	From the old bridge we looked upon the train
2374	Which tow’rds us came upon the other border,
2375	And which the scourges in like manner smite.
2376	And the good Master, without my inquiring,
2377	Said to me: “See that tall one who is coming,
2378	And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;
2379	Still what a royal aspect he retains!
2380	That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning
2381	The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.
2382	He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
2383	After the daring women pitiless
2384	Had unto death devoted all their males.
2385	There with his tokens and with ornate words
2386	Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
2387	Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.
2388	There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;
2389	Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,
2390	And also for Medea is vengeance done.
2391	With him go those who in such wise deceive;
2392	And this sufficient be of the first valley
2393	To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.”
2394	We were already where the narrow path
2395	Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
2396	Of that a buttress for another arch.
2397	Thence we heard people, who are making moan
2398	In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,
2399	And with their palms beating upon themselves
2400	The margins were incrusted with a mould
2401	By exhalation from below, that sticks there,
2402	And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.
2403	The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
2404	To give us sight of it, without ascending
2405	The arch’s back, where most the crag impends.
2406	Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
2407	I saw a people smothered in a filth
2408	That out of human privies seemed to flow;
2409	And whilst below there with mine eye I search,
2410	I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,
2411	It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.
2412	He screamed to me: “Wherefore art thou so eager
2413	To look at me more than the other foul ones?”
2414	And I to him: “Because, if I remember,
2415	I have already seen thee with dry hair,
2416	And thou’rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;
2417	Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.”
2418	And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
2419	“The flatteries have submerged me here below,
2420	Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”
2421	Then said to me the Guide: “See that thou thrust
2422	Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,
2423	That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
2424	Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,
2425	Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,
2426	And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.
2427	Thais the harlot is it, who replied
2428	Unto her paramour, when he said, ‘Have I
2429	Great gratitude from thee?’—‘Nay, marvellous;’
2430	And herewith let our sight be satisfied.”

=== CANTO 19 ===
2431	O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,
2432	Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
2433	The brides of holiness, rapaciously
2434	For silver and for gold do prostitute,
2435	Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,
2436	Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.
2437	We had already on the following tomb
2438	Ascended to that portion of the crag
2439	Which o’er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.
2440	Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest
2441	In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,
2442	And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
2443	I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
2444	The livid stone with perforations filled,
2445	All of one size, and every one was round.
2446	To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
2447	Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
2448	Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
2449	And one of which, not many years ago,
2450	I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
2451	Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
2452	Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
2453	The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
2454	Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
2455	In all of them the soles were both on fire;
2456	Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
2457	They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
2458	Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
2459	To move upon the outer surface only,
2460	So likewise was it there from heel to point.
2461	“Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
2462	More than his other comrades quivering,”
2463	I said, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”
2464	And he to me: “If thou wilt have me bear thee
2465	Down there along that bank which lowest lies,
2466	From him thou’lt know his errors and himself.”
2467	And I: “What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;
2468	Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
2469	From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.”
2470	Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;
2471	We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
2472	Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.
2473	And the good Master yet from off his haunch
2474	Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
2475	Of him who so lamented with his shanks.
2476	“Whoe’er thou art, that standest upside down,
2477	O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,”
2478	To say began I, “if thou canst, speak out.”
2479	I stood even as the friar who is confessing
2480	The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,
2481	Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
2482	And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,
2483	Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
2484	By many years the record lied to me.
2485	Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
2486	For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
2487	The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?”
2488	Such I became, as people are who stand,
2489	Not comprehending what is answered them,
2490	As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
2491	Then said Virgilius: “Say to him straightway,
2492	‘I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.’”
2493	And I replied as was imposed on me.
2494	Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
2495	Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
2496	Said to me: “Then what wantest thou of me?
2497	If who I am thou carest so much to know,
2498	That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
2499	Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
2500	And truly was I son of the She-bear,
2501	So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
2502	Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
2503	Beneath my head the others are dragged down
2504	Who have preceded me in simony,
2505	Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
2506	Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
2507	That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
2508	What time the sudden question I proposed.
2509	But longer I my feet already toast,
2510	And here have been in this way upside down,
2511	Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
2512	For after him shall come of fouler deed
2513	From tow’rds the west a Pastor without law,
2514	Such as befits to cover him and me.
2515	New Jason will he be, of whom we read
2516	In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
2517	So he who governs France shall be to this one.”
2518	I do not know if I were here too bold,
2519	That him I answered only in this metre:
2520	“I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
2521	Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
2522	Before he put the keys into his keeping?
2523	Truly he nothing asked but ‘Follow me.’
2524	Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
2525	Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
2526	Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
2527	Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
2528	And keep safe guard o’er the ill-gotten money,
2529	Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
2530	And were it not that still forbids it me
2531	The reverence for the keys superlative
2532	Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
2533	I would make use of words more grievous still;
2534	Because your avarice afflicts the world,
2535	Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
2536	The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
2537	When she who sitteth upon many waters
2538	To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
2539	The same who with the seven heads was born,
2540	And power and strength from the ten horns received,
2541	So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
2542	Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
2543	And from the idolater how differ ye,
2544	Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
2545	Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
2546	Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
2547	Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!”
2548	And while I sang to him such notes as these,
2549	Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
2550	He struggled violently with both his feet.
2551	I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
2552	With such contented lip he listened ever
2553	Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
2554	Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
2555	And when he had me all upon his breast,
2556	Remounted by the way where he descended.
2557	Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
2558	But bore me to the summit of the arch
2559	Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
2560	There tenderly he laid his burden down,
2561	Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
2562	That would have been hard passage for the goats:
2563	Thence was unveiled to me another valley.

=== CANTO 20 ===
2564	Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
2565	And give material to the twentieth canto
2566	Of the first song, which is of the submerged.
2567	I was already thoroughly disposed
2568	To peer down into the uncovered depth,
2569	Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
2570	And people saw I through the circular valley,
2571	Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
2572	Which in this world the Litanies assume.
2573	As lower down my sight descended on them,
2574	Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
2575	From chin to the beginning of the chest;
2576	For tow’rds the reins the countenance was turned,
2577	And backward it behoved them to advance,
2578	As to look forward had been taken from them.
2579	Perchance indeed by violence of palsy
2580	Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;
2581	But I ne’er saw it, nor believe it can be.
2582	As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
2583	From this thy reading, think now for thyself
2584	How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
2585	When our own image near me I beheld
2586	Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
2587	Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.
2588	Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
2589	Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
2590	To me: “Art thou, too, of the other fools?
2591	Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;
2592	Who is a greater reprobate than he
2593	Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
2594	Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
2595	Opened the earth before the Thebans’ eyes;
2596	Wherefore they all cried: ‘Whither rushest thou,
2597	Amphiaraus? Why dost leave the war?’
2598	And downward ceased he not to fall amain
2599	As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
2600	See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
2601	Because he wished to see too far before him
2602	Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
2603	Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
2604	When from a male a female he became,
2605	His members being all of them transformed;
2606	And afterwards was forced to strike once more
2607	The two entangled serpents with his rod,
2608	Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
2609	That Aruns is, who backs the other’s belly,
2610	Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
2611	The Carrarese who houses underneath,
2612	Among the marbles white a cavern had
2613	For his abode; whence to behold the stars
2614	And sea, the view was not cut off from him.
2615	And she there, who is covering up her breasts,
2616	Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,
2617	And on that side has all the hairy skin,
2618	Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,
2619	Afterwards tarried there where I was born;
2620	Whereof I would thou list to me a little.
2621	After her father had from life departed,
2622	And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,
2623	She a long season wandered through the world.
2624	Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
2625	At the Alp’s foot that shuts in Germany
2626	Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.
2627	By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,
2628	’Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,
2629	With water that grows stagnant in that lake.
2630	Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,
2631	And he of Brescia, and the Veronese
2632	Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.
2633	Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
2634	To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
2635	Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
2636	There of necessity must fall whatever
2637	In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
2638	And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
2639	Soon as the water doth begin to run,
2640	No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
2641	Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
2642	Not far it runs before it finds a plain
2643	In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
2644	And oft ’tis wont in summer to be sickly.
2645	Passing that way the virgin pitiless
2646	Land in the middle of the fen descried,
2647	Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
2648	There to escape all human intercourse,
2649	She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
2650	And lived, and left her empty body there.
2651	The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,
2652	Collected in that place, which was made strong
2653	By the lagoon it had on every side;
2654	They built their city over those dead bones,
2655	And, after her who first the place selected,
2656	Mantua named it, without other omen.
2657	Its people once within more crowded were,
2658	Ere the stupidity of Casalodi
2659	From Pinamonte had received deceit.
2660	Therefore I caution thee, if e’er thou hearest
2661	Originate my city otherwise,
2662	No falsehood may the verity defraud.”
2663	And I: “My Master, thy discourses are
2664	To me so certain, and so take my faith,
2665	That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
2666	But tell me of the people who are passing,
2667	If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
2668	For only unto that my mind reverts.”
2669	Then said he to me: “He who from the cheek
2670	Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
2671	Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,
2672	So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,
2673	An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,
2674	In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.
2675	Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
2676	My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;
2677	That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.
2678	The next, who is so slender in the flanks,
2679	Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
2680	Of magical illusions knew the game.
2681	Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
2682	Who now unto his leather and his thread
2683	Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.
2684	Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,
2685	The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;
2686	They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.
2687	But come now, for already holds the confines
2688	Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville
2689	Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,
2690	And yesternight the moon was round already;
2691	Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
2692	From time to time within the forest deep.”
2693	Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.

=== CANTO 21 ===
2694	From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
2695	Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
2696	We came along, and held the summit, when
2697	We halted to behold another fissure
2698	Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
2699	And I beheld it marvellously dark.
2700	As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
2701	Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
2702	To smear their unsound vessels o’er again,
2703	For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
2704	One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
2705	The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
2706	One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
2707	This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
2708	Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
2709	Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
2710	Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
2711	Which upon every side the bank belimed.
2712	I saw it, but I did not see within it
2713	Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
2714	And all swell up and resubside compressed.
2715	The while below there fixedly I gazed,
2716	My Leader, crying out: “Beware, beware!”
2717	Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
2718	Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
2719	To see what it behoves him to escape,
2720	And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
2721	Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
2722	And I beheld behind us a black devil,
2723	Running along upon the crag, approach.
2724	Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
2725	And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
2726	With open wings and light upon his feet!
2727	His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
2728	A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
2729	And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
2730	From off our bridge, he said: “O Malebranche,
2731	Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
2732	Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
2733	Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
2734	All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
2735	No into Yes for money there is changed.”
2736	He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
2737	Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
2738	In so much hurry to pursue a thief.
2739	The other sank, and rose again face downward;
2740	But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
2741	Cried: “Here the Santo Volto has no place!
2742	Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
2743	Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
2744	Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.”
2745	They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;
2746	They said: “It here behoves thee to dance covered,
2747	That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.”
2748	Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
2749	Immerse into the middle of the caldron
2750	The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
2751	Said the good Master to me: “That it be not
2752	Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down
2753	Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;
2754	And for no outrage that is done to me
2755	Be thou afraid, because these things I know,
2756	For once before was I in such a scuffle.”
2757	Then he passed on beyond the bridge’s head,
2758	And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
2759	Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
2760	With the same fury, and the same uproar,
2761	As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
2762	Who on a sudden begs, where’er he stops,
2763	They issued from beneath the little bridge,
2764	And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
2765	But he cried out: “Be none of you malignant!
2766	Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,
2767	Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,
2768	And then take counsel as to grappling me.”
2769	They all cried out: “Let Malacoda go;”
2770	Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
2771	And he came to him, saying: “What avails it?”
2772	“Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
2773	Advanced into this place,” my Master said,
2774	“Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,
2775	Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?
2776	Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed
2777	That I another show this savage road.”
2778	Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
2779	That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
2780	And to the others said: “Now strike him not.”
2781	And unto me my Guide: “O thou, who sittest
2782	Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
2783	Securely now return to me again.”
2784	Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
2785	And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
2786	So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
2787	And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
2788	Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
2789	Seeing themselves among so many foes.
2790	Close did I press myself with all my person
2791	Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
2792	From off their countenance, which was not good.
2793	They lowered their rakes, and “Wilt thou have me hit him,”
2794	They said to one another, “on the rump?”
2795	And answered: “Yes; see that thou nick him with it.”
2796	But the same demon who was holding parley
2797	With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
2798	And said: “Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;”
2799	Then said to us: “You can no farther go
2800	Forward upon this crag, because is lying
2801	All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
2802	And if it still doth please you to go onward,
2803	Pursue your way along upon this rock;
2804	Near is another crag that yields a path.
2805	Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
2806	One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
2807	Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
2808	I send in that direction some of mine
2809	To see if any one doth air himself;
2810	Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
2811	Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”
2812	Began he to cry out, “and thou, Cagnazzo;
2813	And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
2814	Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
2815	And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
2816	And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
2817	Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
2818	Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
2819	That all unbroken passes o’er the dens.”
2820	“O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
2821	Pray let us go,” I said, “without an escort,
2822	If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
2823	If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
2824	Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
2825	And with their brows are threatening woe to us?”
2826	And he to me: “I will not have thee fear;
2827	Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,
2828	Because they do it for those boiling wretches.”
2829	Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
2830	But first had each one thrust his tongue between
2831	His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
2832	And he had made a trumpet of his rump.

=== CANTO 22 ===
2833	I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
2834	Begin the storming, and their muster make,
2835	And sometimes starting off for their escape;
2836	Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
2837	O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
2838	Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
2839	Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
2840	With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
2841	And with our own, and with outlandish things,
2842	But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
2843	Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
2844	Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
2845	We went upon our way with the ten demons;
2846	Ah, savage company! but in the church
2847	With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
2848	Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
2849	To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
2850	And of the people who therein were burned.
2851	Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
2852	To mariners by arching of the back,
2853	That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
2854	Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
2855	One of the sinners would display his back,
2856	And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
2857	As on the brink of water in a ditch
2858	The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
2859	So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
2860	So upon every side the sinners stood;
2861	But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
2862	Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
2863	I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
2864	One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
2865	One frog remains, and down another dives;
2866	And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
2867	Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
2868	And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.
2869	I knew, before, the names of all of them,
2870	So had I noted them when they were chosen,
2871	And when they called each other, listened how.
2872	“O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
2873	Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,”
2874	Cried all together the accursed ones.
2875	And I: “My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
2876	That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
2877	Thus come into his adversaries’ hands.”
2878	Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
2879	Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
2880	“I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
2881	My mother placed me servant to a lord,
2882	For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
2883	Destroyer of himself and of his things.
2884	Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
2885	I set me there to practise barratry,
2886	For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.”
2887	And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
2888	On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
2889	Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
2890	Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
2891	But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
2892	And said: “Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.”
2893	And to my Master he turned round his head;
2894	“Ask him again,” he said, “if more thou wish
2895	To know from him, before some one destroy him.”
2896	The Guide: “Now tell then of the other culprits;
2897	Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,
2898	Under the pitch?” And he: “I separated
2899	Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
2900	Would that I still were covered up with him,
2901	For I should fear not either claw nor hook!”
2902	And Libicocco: “We have borne too much;”
2903	And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
2904	So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.
2905	Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
2906	Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
2907	Turned round and round about with evil look.
2908	When they again somewhat were pacified,
2909	Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
2910	Demanded my Conductor without stay:
2911	“Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting
2912	Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?”
2913	And he replied: “It was the Friar Gomita,
2914	He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
2915	Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
2916	And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
2917	Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
2918	As he says; and in other offices
2919	A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
2920	Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
2921	Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
2922	To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
2923	O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
2924	Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
2925	Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.”
2926	And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
2927	Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
2928	Said: “Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.”
2929	“If you desire either to see or hear,”
2930	The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
2931	“Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
2932	But let the Malebranche cease a little,
2933	So that these may not their revenges fear,
2934	And I, down sitting in this very place,
2935	For one that I am will make seven come,
2936	When I shall whistle, as our custom is
2937	To do whenever one of us comes out.”
2938	Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
2939	Shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick
2940	Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”
2941	Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
2942	Responded: “I by far too cunning am,
2943	When I procure for mine a greater sadness.”
2944	Alichin held not in, but running counter
2945	Unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive,
2946	I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
2947	But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
2948	The height be left, and be the bank a shield
2949	To see if thou alone dost countervail us.”
2950	O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
2951	Each to the other side his eyes averted;
2952	He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
2953	The Navarrese selected well his time;
2954	Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
2955	Leaped, and released himself from their design.
2956	Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
2957	But he most who was cause of the defeat;
2958	Therefore he moved, and cried: “Thou art o’ertakern.”
2959	But little it availed, for wings could not
2960	Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
2961	And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
2962	Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
2963	Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
2964	And upward he returneth cross and weary.
2965	Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
2966	Flying behind him followed close, desirous
2967	The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
2968	And when the barrator had disappeared,
2969	He turned his talons upon his companion,
2970	And grappled with him right above the moat.
2971	But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
2972	To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
2973	Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
2974	A sudden intercessor was the heat;
2975	But ne’ertheless of rising there was naught,
2976	To such degree they had their wings belimed.
2977	Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
2978	Made four of them fly to the other side
2979	With all their gaffs, and very speedily
2980	This side and that they to their posts descended;
2981	They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
2982	Who were already baked within the crust,
2983	And in this manner busied did we leave them.

=== CANTO 23 ===
2984	Silent, alone, and without company
2985	We went, the one in front, the other after,
2986	As go the Minor Friars along their way.
2987	Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
2988	My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
2989	Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
2990	For ‘mo’ and ‘issa’ are not more alike
2991	Than this one is to that, if well we couple
2992	End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
2993	And even as one thought from another springs,
2994	So afterward from that was born another,
2995	Which the first fear within me double made.
2996	Thus did I ponder: “These on our account
2997	Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
2998	So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
2999	If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
3000	They will come after us more merciless
3001	Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,”
3002	I felt my hair stand all on end already
3003	With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
3004	When said I: “Master, if thou hidest not
3005	Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
3006	I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
3007	I so imagine them, I already feel them.”
3008	And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,
3009	Thine outward image I should not attract
3010	Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
3011	Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,
3012	With similar attitude and similar face,
3013	So that of both one counsel sole I made.
3014	If peradventure the right bank so slope
3015	That we to the next Bolgia can descend,
3016	We shall escape from the imagined chase.”
3017	Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
3018	When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
3019	Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
3020	My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
3021	Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
3022	And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
3023	Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
3024	Having more care of him than of herself,
3025	So that she clothes her only with a shift;
3026	And downward from the top of the hard bank
3027	Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
3028	That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
3029	Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
3030	To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
3031	When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
3032	As did my Master down along that border,
3033	Bearing me with him on his breast away,
3034	As his own son, and not as a companion.
3035	Hardly the bed of the ravine below
3036	His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
3037	Right over us; but he was not afraid;
3038	For the high Providence, which had ordained
3039	To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
3040	The power of thence departing took from all.
3041	A painted people there below we found,
3042	Who went about with footsteps very slow,
3043	Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.
3044	They had on mantles with the hoods low down
3045	Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
3046	That in Cologne they for the monks are made.
3047	Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;
3048	But inwardly all leaden and so heavy
3049	That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
3050	O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
3051	Again we turned us, still to the left hand
3052	Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
3053	But owing to the weight, that weary folk
3054	Came on so tardily, that we were new
3055	In company at each motion of the haunch.
3056	Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find
3057	Some one who may by deed or name be known,
3058	And thus in going move thine eye about.”
3059	And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
3060	Cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet,
3061	Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
3062	Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.”
3063	Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait,
3064	And then according to his pace proceed.”
3065	I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
3066	Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
3067	But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
3068	When they came up, long with an eye askance
3069	They scanned me without uttering a word.
3070	Then to each other turned, and said together:
3071	“He by the action of his throat seems living;
3072	And if they dead are, by what privilege
3073	Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”
3074	Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college
3075	Of miserable hypocrites art come,
3076	Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”
3077	And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up
3078	In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
3079	And with the body am I’ve always had.
3080	But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
3081	Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
3082	And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”
3083	And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks
3084	Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
3085	Cause in this way their balances to creak.
3086	Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
3087	I Catalano, and he Loderingo
3088	Named, and together taken by thy city,
3089	As the wont is to take one man alone,
3090	For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
3091	That still it is apparent round Gardingo.”
3092	“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous. . .”
3093	But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
3094	One crucified with three stakes on the ground.
3095	When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,
3096	Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
3097	And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
3098	Said to me: “This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
3099	Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
3100	To put one man to torture for the people.
3101	Crosswise and naked is he on the path,
3102	As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,
3103	Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
3104	And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
3105	Within this moat, and the others of the council,
3106	Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”
3107	And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel
3108	O’er him who was extended on the cross
3109	So vilely in eternal banishment.
3110	Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
3111	“Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us
3112	If to the right hand any pass slope down
3113	By which we two may issue forth from here,
3114	Without constraining some of the black angels
3115	To come and extricate us from this deep.”
3116	Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest
3117	There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
3118	Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
3119	Save that at this ’tis broken, and does not bridge it;
3120	You will be able to mount up the ruin,
3121	That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”
3122	The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;
3123	Then said: “The business badly he recounted
3124	Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”
3125	And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices
3126	Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
3127	That he’s a liar and the father of lies.”
3128	Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
3129	Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
3130	Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
3131	After the prints of his beloved feet.

=== CANTO 24 ===
3132	In that part of the youthful year wherein
3133	The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
3134	And now the nights draw near to half the day,
3135	What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
3136	The outward semblance of her sister white,
3137	But little lasts the temper of her pen,
3138	The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
3139	Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
3140	All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
3141	Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
3142	Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
3143	Then he returns and hope revives again,
3144	Seeing the world has changed its countenance
3145	In little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook,
3146	And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
3147	Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
3148	When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
3149	And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
3150	For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
3151	The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
3152	Which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.
3153	His arms he opened, after some advisement
3154	Within himself elected, looking first
3155	Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
3156	And even as he who acts and meditates,
3157	For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
3158	So upward lifting me towards the summit
3159	Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
3160	Saying: “To that one grapple afterwards,
3161	But try first if ’tis such that it will hold thee.”
3162	This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
3163	For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
3164	Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
3165	And had it not been, that upon that precinct
3166	Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
3167	He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
3168	But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth
3169	Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
3170	The structure of each valley doth import
3171	That one bank rises and the other sinks.
3172	Still we arrived at length upon the point
3173	Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
3174	The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
3175	When I was up, that I could go no farther,
3176	Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
3177	“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,”
3178	My Master said; “for sitting upon down,
3179	Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
3180	Withouten which whoso his life consumes
3181	Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
3182	As smoke in air or in the water foam.
3183	And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish
3184	With spirit that o’ercometh every battle,
3185	If with its heavy body it sink not.
3186	A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
3187	’Tis not enough from these to have departed;
3188	Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”
3189	Then I uprose, showing myself provided
3190	Better with breath than I did feel myself,
3191	And said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”
3192	Upward we took our way along the crag,
3193	Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
3194	And more precipitous far than that before.
3195	Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
3196	Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
3197	Not well adapted to articulate words.
3198	I know not what it said, though o’er the back
3199	I now was of the arch that passes there;
3200	But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
3201	I was bent downward, but my living eyes
3202	Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
3203	Wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive
3204	At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
3205	For as from hence I hear and understand not,
3206	So I look down and nothing I distinguish.”
3207	“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not,
3208	Except the doing; for the modest asking
3209	Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”
3210	We from the bridge descended at its head,
3211	Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
3212	And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
3213	And I beheld therein a terrible throng
3214	Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,
3215	That the remembrance still congeals my blood
3216	Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;
3217	For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae
3218	She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,
3219	Neither so many plagues nor so malignant
3220	E’er showed she with all Ethiopia,
3221	Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!
3222	Among this cruel and most dismal throng
3223	People were running naked and affrighted.
3224	Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.
3225	They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;
3226	These riveted upon their reins the tail
3227	And head, and were in front of them entwined.
3228	And lo! at one who was upon our side
3229	There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
3230	There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.
3231	Nor ‘O’ so quickly e’er, nor ‘I’ was written,
3232	As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
3233	Behoved it that in falling he became.
3234	And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,
3235	The ashes drew together, and of themselves
3236	Into himself they instantly returned.
3237	Even thus by the great sages ’tis confessed
3238	The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
3239	When it approaches its five-hundredth year;
3240	On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
3241	But only on tears of incense and amomum,
3242	And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
3243	And as he is who falls, and knows not how,
3244	By force of demons who to earth down drag him,
3245	Or other oppilation that binds man,
3246	When he arises and around him looks,
3247	Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
3248	Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;
3249	Such was that sinner after he had risen.
3250	Justice of God! O how severe it is,
3251	That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
3252	The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
3253	Whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany
3254	A short time since into this cruel gorge.
3255	A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,
3256	Even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci,
3257	Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”
3258	And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not,
3259	And ask what crime has thrust him here below,
3260	For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”
3261	And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,
3262	But unto me directed mind and face,
3263	And with a melancholy shame was painted.
3264	Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me
3265	Amid this misery where thou seest me,
3266	Than when I from the other life was taken.
3267	What thou demandest I cannot deny;
3268	So low am I put down because I robbed
3269	The sacristy of the fair ornaments,
3270	And falsely once ’twas laid upon another;
3271	But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
3272	If thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,
3273	Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
3274	Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
3275	Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
3276	Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
3277	Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
3278	And with impetuous and bitter tempest
3279	Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
3280	When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
3281	So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.
3282	And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”

=== CANTO 25 ===
3283	At the conclusion of his words, the thief
3284	Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,
3285	Crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”
3286	From that time forth the serpents were my friends;
3287	For one entwined itself about his neck
3288	As if it said: “I will not thou speak more;”
3289	And round his arms another, and rebound him,
3290	Clinching itself together so in front,
3291	That with them he could not a motion make.
3292	Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
3293	To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,
3294	Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
3295	Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,
3296	Spirit I saw not against God so proud,
3297	Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
3298	He fled away, and spake no further word;
3299	And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
3300	Come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”
3301	I do not think Maremma has so many
3302	Serpents as he had all along his back,
3303	As far as where our countenance begins.
3304	Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,
3305	With wings wide open was a dragon lying,
3306	And he sets fire to all that he encounters.
3307	My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who
3308	Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine
3309	Created oftentimes a lake of blood.
3310	He goes not on the same road with his brothers,
3311	By reason of the fraudulent theft he made
3312	Of the great herd, which he had near to him;
3313	Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
3314	The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
3315	Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”
3316	While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
3317	And spirits three had underneath us come,
3318	Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
3319	Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?”
3320	On which account our story made a halt,
3321	And then we were intent on them alone.
3322	I did not know them; but it came to pass,
3323	As it is wont to happen by some chance,
3324	That one to name the other was compelled,
3325	Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?”
3326	Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
3327	Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
3328	If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
3329	What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
3330	For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
3331	As I was holding raised on them my brows,
3332	Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
3333	In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
3334	With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
3335	And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
3336	Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
3337	The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
3338	And put its tail through in between the two,
3339	And up behind along the reins outspread it.
3340	Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
3341	Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
3342	Upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.
3343	Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
3344	They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
3345	Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
3346	E’en as proceedeth on before the flame
3347	Upward along the paper a brown colour,
3348	Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
3349	The other two looked on, and each of them
3350	Cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
3351	Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”
3352	Already the two heads had one become,
3353	When there appeared to us two figures mingled
3354	Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
3355	Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
3356	The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
3357	Members became that never yet were seen.
3358	Every original aspect there was cancelled;
3359	Two and yet none did the perverted image
3360	Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
3361	Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
3362	Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
3363	Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
3364	Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
3365	Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
3366	Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
3367	And in that part whereat is first received
3368	Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
3369	Then downward fell in front of him extended.
3370	The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
3371	Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
3372	Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
3373	He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
3374	One through the wound, the other through the mouth
3375	Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
3376	Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
3377	Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
3378	And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
3379	Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
3380	For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
3381	Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
3382	Because two natures never front to front
3383	Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
3384	To interchange their matter ready were.
3385	Together they responded in such wise,
3386	That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
3387	And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
3388	The legs together with the thighs themselves
3389	Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
3390	No sign whatever made that was apparent.
3391	He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
3392	The other one was losing, and his skin
3393	Became elastic, and the other’s hard.
3394	I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
3395	And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
3396	Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
3397	Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
3398	Became the member that a man conceals,
3399	And of his own the wretch had two created.
3400	While both of them the exhalation veils
3401	With a new colour, and engenders hair
3402	On one of them and depilates the other,
3403	The one uprose and down the other fell,
3404	Though turning not away their impious lamps,
3405	Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
3406	He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples,
3407	And from excess of matter, which came thither,
3408	Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
3409	What did not backward run and was retained
3410	Of that excess made to the face a nose,
3411	And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
3412	He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
3413	And backward draws the ears into his head,
3414	In the same manner as the snail its horns;
3415	And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
3416	For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
3417	In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
3418	The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
3419	Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
3420	And after him the other speaking sputters.
3421	Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
3422	And said to the other: “I’ll have Buoso run,
3423	Crawling as I have done, along this road.”
3424	In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
3425	Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
3426	The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
3427	And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
3428	Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
3429	They could not flee away so secretly
3430	But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
3431	And he it was who sole of three companions,
3432	Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
3433	The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.

=== CANTO 26 ===
3434	Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
3435	That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,
3436	And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
3437	Among the thieves five citizens of thine
3438	Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,
3439	And thou thereby to no great honour risest.
3440	But if when morn is near our dreams are true,
3441	Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
3442	What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.
3443	And if it now were, it were not too soon;
3444	Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
3445	For ’twill aggrieve me more the more I age.
3446	We went our way, and up along the stairs
3447	The bourns had made us to descend before,
3448	Remounted my Conductor and drew me.
3449	And following the solitary path
3450	Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
3451	The foot without the hand sped not at all.
3452	Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
3453	When I direct my mind to what I saw,
3454	And more my genius curb than I am wont,
3455	That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
3456	So that if some good star, or better thing,
3457	Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
3458	As many as the hind (who on the hill
3459	Rests at the time when he who lights the world
3460	His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
3461	While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
3462	Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
3463	Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
3464	With flames as manifold resplendent all
3465	Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
3466	As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
3467	And such as he who with the bears avenged him
3468	Beheld Elijah’s chariot at departing,
3469	What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
3470	For with his eye he could not follow it
3471	So as to see aught else than flame alone,
3472	Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
3473	Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
3474	Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
3475	And every flame a sinner steals away.
3476	I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
3477	So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
3478	Down had I fallen without being pushed.
3479	And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
3480	Exclaimed: “Within the fires the spirits are;
3481	Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.”
3482	“My Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee
3483	I am more sure; but I surmised already
3484	It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
3485	Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
3486	At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
3487	Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.”
3488	He answered me: “Within there are tormented
3489	Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together
3490	They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.
3491	And there within their flame do they lament
3492	The ambush of the horse, which made the door
3493	Whence issued forth the Romans’ gentle seed;
3494	Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
3495	Deidamia still deplores Achilles,
3496	And pain for the Palladium there is borne.”
3497	“If they within those sparks possess the power
3498	To speak,” I said, “thee, Master, much I pray,
3499	And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
3500	That thou make no denial of awaiting
3501	Until the horned flame shall hither come;
3502	Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.”
3503	And he to me: “Worthy is thy entreaty
3504	Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;
3505	But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.
3506	Leave me to speak, because I have conceived
3507	That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
3508	Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.”
3509	When now the flame had come unto that point,
3510	Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
3511	After this fashion did I hear him speak:
3512	“O ye, who are twofold within one fire,
3513	If I deserved of you, while I was living,
3514	If I deserved of you or much or little
3515	When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
3516	Do not move on, but one of you declare
3517	Whither, being lost, he went away to die.”
3518	Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
3519	Murmuring, began to wave itself about
3520	Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
3521	Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
3522	Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
3523	It uttered forth a voice, and said: “When I
3524	From Circe had departed, who concealed me
3525	More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
3526	Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
3527	Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
3528	For my old father, nor the due affection
3529	Which joyous should have made Penelope,
3530	Could overcome within me the desire
3531	I had to be experienced of the world,
3532	And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
3533	But I put forth on the high open sea
3534	With one sole ship, and that small company
3535	By which I never had deserted been.
3536	Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
3537	Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
3538	And the others which that sea bathes round about.
3539	I and my company were old and slow
3540	When at that narrow passage we arrived
3541	Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
3542	That man no farther onward should adventure.
3543	On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
3544	And on the other already had left Ceuta.
3545	‘O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
3546	Perils,’ I said, ‘have come unto the West,
3547	To this so inconsiderable vigil
3548	Which is remaining of your senses still
3549	Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
3550	Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
3551	Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
3552	Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
3553	But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.’
3554	So eager did I render my companions,
3555	With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
3556	That then I hardly could have held them back.
3557	And having turned our stern unto the morning,
3558	We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
3559	Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
3560	Already all the stars of the other pole
3561	The night beheld, and ours so very low
3562	It did not rise above the ocean floor.
3563	Five times rekindled and as many quenched
3564	Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
3565	Since we had entered into the deep pass,
3566	When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
3567	From distance, and it seemed to me so high
3568	As I had never any one beheld.
3569	Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
3570	For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
3571	And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
3572	Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
3573	At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
3574	And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
3575	Until the sea above us closed again.”

=== CANTO 27 ===
3576	Already was the flame erect and quiet,
3577	To speak no more, and now departed from us
3578	With the permission of the gentle Poet;
3579	When yet another, which behind it came,
3580	Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
3581	By a confused sound that issued from it.
3582	As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
3583	With the lament of him, and that was right,
3584	Who with his file had modulated it)
3585	Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
3586	That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
3587	Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
3588	Thus, by not having any way or issue
3589	At first from out the fire, to its own language
3590	Converted were the melancholy words.
3591	But afterwards, when they had gathered way
3592	Up through the point, giving it that vibration
3593	The tongue had given them in their passage out,
3594	We heard it said: “O thou, at whom I aim
3595	My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
3596	Saying, ‘Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,’
3597	Because I come perchance a little late,
3598	To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
3599	Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
3600	If thou but lately into this blind world
3601	Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
3602	Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
3603	Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
3604	For I was from the mountains there between
3605	Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.”
3606	I still was downward bent and listening,
3607	When my Conductor touched me on the side,
3608	Saying: “Speak thou: this one a Latian is.”
3609	And I, who had beforehand my reply
3610	In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
3611	“O soul, that down below there art concealed,
3612	Romagna thine is not and never has been
3613	Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
3614	But open war I none have left there now.
3615	Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
3616	The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
3617	So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
3618	The city which once made the long resistance,
3619	And of the French a sanguinary heap,
3620	Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
3621	Verrucchio’s ancient Mastiff and the new,
3622	Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
3623	Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
3624	The cities of Lamone and Santerno
3625	Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
3626	Who changes sides ’twixt summer-time and winter;
3627	And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
3628	Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
3629	Lives between tyranny and a free state.
3630	Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
3631	Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
3632	So may thy name hold front there in the world.”
3633	After the fire a little more had roared
3634	In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
3635	This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
3636	“If I believed that my reply were made
3637	To one who to the world would e’er return,
3638	This flame without more flickering would stand still;
3639	But inasmuch as never from this depth
3640	Did any one return, if I hear true,
3641	Without the fear of infamy I answer,
3642	I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
3643	Believing thus begirt to make amends;
3644	And truly my belief had been fulfilled
3645	But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
3646	Who put me back into my former sins;
3647	And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
3648	While I was still the form of bone and pulp
3649	My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
3650	Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
3651	The machinations and the covert ways
3652	I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
3653	That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
3654	When now unto that portion of mine age
3655	I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
3656	To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
3657	That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
3658	And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
3659	Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
3660	The Leader of the modern Pharisees
3661	Having a war near unto Lateran,
3662	And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
3663	For each one of his enemies was Christian,
3664	And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
3665	Nor merchandising in the Sultan’s land,
3666	Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
3667	In him regarded, nor in me that cord
3668	Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
3669	But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
3670	To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
3671	So this one sought me out as an adept
3672	To cure him of the fever of his pride.
3673	Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
3674	Because his words appeared inebriate.
3675	And then he said: ‘Be not thy heart afraid;
3676	Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
3677	How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
3678	Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
3679	As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
3680	The which my predecessor held not dear.’
3681	Then urged me on his weighty arguments
3682	There, where my silence was the worst advice;
3683	And said I: ‘Father, since thou washest me
3684	Of that sin into which I now must fall,
3685	The promise long with the fulfilment short
3686	Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’
3687	Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
3688	For me; but one of the black Cherubim
3689	Said to him: ‘Take him not; do me no wrong;
3690	He must come down among my servitors,
3691	Because he gave the fraudulent advice
3692	From which time forth I have been at his hair;
3693	For who repents not cannot be absolved,
3694	Nor can one both repent and will at once,
3695	Because of the contradiction which consents not.’
3696	O miserable me! how I did shudder
3697	When he seized on me, saying: ‘Peradventure
3698	Thou didst not think that I was a logician!’
3699	He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
3700	Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
3701	And after he had bitten it in great rage,
3702	Said: ‘Of the thievish fire a culprit this;’
3703	Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
3704	And vested thus in going I bemoan me.”
3705	When it had thus completed its recital,
3706	The flame departed uttering lamentations,
3707	Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
3708	Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
3709	Up o’er the crag above another arch,
3710	Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
3711	By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.

=== CANTO 28 ===
3712	Who ever could, e’en with untrammelled words,
3713	Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
3714	Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
3715	Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
3716	By reason of our speech and memory,
3717	That have small room to comprehend so much.
3718	If were again assembled all the people
3719	Which formerly upon the fateful land
3720	Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
3721	Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
3722	That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
3723	As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
3724	With those who felt the agony of blows
3725	By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
3726	And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
3727	At Ceperano, where a renegade
3728	Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,
3729	Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,
3730	And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,
3731	Should show, it would be nothing to compare
3732	With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.
3733	A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
3734	Was never shattered so, as I saw one
3735	Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.
3736	Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;
3737	His heart was visible, and the dismal sack
3738	That maketh excrement of what is eaten.
3739	While I was all absorbed in seeing him,
3740	He looked at me, and opened with his hands
3741	His bosom, saying: “See now how I rend me;
3742	How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;
3743	In front of me doth Ali weeping go,
3744	Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
3745	And all the others whom thou here beholdest,
3746	Disseminators of scandal and of schism
3747	While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.
3748	A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
3749	Thus cruelly, unto the falchion’s edge
3750	Putting again each one of all this ream,
3751	When we have gone around the doleful road;
3752	By reason that our wounds are closed again
3753	Ere any one in front of him repass.
3754	But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
3755	Perchance to postpone going to the pain
3756	That is adjudged upon thine accusations?”
3757	“Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,”
3758	My Master made reply, “to be tormented;
3759	But to procure him full experience,
3760	Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
3761	Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;
3762	And this is true as that I speak to thee.”
3763	More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
3764	Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
3765	Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
3766	“Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
3767	Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
3768	If soon he wish not here to follow me,
3769	So with provisions, that no stress of snow
3770	May give the victory to the Novarese,
3771	Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.”
3772	After one foot to go away he lifted,
3773	This word did Mahomet say unto me,
3774	Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
3775	Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
3776	And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
3777	And had no longer but a single ear,
3778	Staying to look in wonder with the others,
3779	Before the others did his gullet open,
3780	Which outwardly was red in every part,
3781	And said: “O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
3782	And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
3783	Unless too great similitude deceive me,
3784	Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
3785	If e’er thou see again the lovely plain
3786	That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
3787	And make it known to the best two of Fano,
3788	To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
3789	That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
3790	Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
3791	And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
3792	By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
3793	Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
3794	Neptune ne’er yet beheld so great a crime,
3795	Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
3796	That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
3797	And holds the land, which some one here with me
3798	Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
3799	Will make them come unto a parley with him;
3800	Then will do so, that to Focara’s wind
3801	They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.”
3802	And I to him: “Show to me and declare,
3803	If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
3804	Who is this person of the bitter vision.”
3805	Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
3806	Of one of his companions, and his mouth
3807	Oped, crying: “This is he, and he speaks not.
3808	This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
3809	In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
3810	Always with detriment allowed delay.”
3811	O how bewildered unto me appeared,
3812	With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,
3813	Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
3814	And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
3815	The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
3816	So that the blood made horrible his face,
3817	Cried out: “Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
3818	Who said, alas! ‘A thing done has an end!’
3819	Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.”
3820	“And death unto thy race,” thereto I added;
3821	Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
3822	Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
3823	But I remained to look upon the crowd;
3824	And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
3825	Without some further proof, even to recount,
3826	If it were not that conscience reassures me,
3827	That good companion which emboldens man
3828	Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
3829	I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
3830	A trunk without a head walk in like manner
3831	As walked the others of the mournful herd.
3832	And by the hair it held the head dissevered,
3833	Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
3834	And that upon us gazed and said: “O me!”
3835	It of itself made to itself a lamp,
3836	And they were two in one, and one in two;
3837	How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
3838	When it was come close to the bridge’s foot,
3839	It lifted high its arm with all the head,
3840	To bring more closely unto us its words,
3841	Which were: “Behold now the sore penalty,
3842	Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
3843	Behold if any be as great as this.
3844	And so that thou may carry news of me,
3845	Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
3846	Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
3847	I made the father and the son rebellious;
3848	Achitophel not more with Absalom
3849	And David did with his accursed goadings.
3850	Because I parted persons so united,
3851	Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
3852	From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
3853	Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.”

=== CANTO 29 ===
3854	The many people and the divers wounds
3855	These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
3856	That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
3857	But said Virgilius: “What dost thou still gaze at?
3858	Why is thy sight still riveted down there
3859	Among the mournful, mutilated shades?
3860	Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;
3861	Consider, if to count them thou believest,
3862	That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,
3863	And now the moon is underneath our feet;
3864	Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,
3865	And more is to be seen than what thou seest.”
3866	“If thou hadst,” I made answer thereupon,
3867	“Attended to the cause for which I looked,
3868	Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.”
3869	Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
3870	I went, already making my reply,
3871	And superadding: “In that cavern where
3872	I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
3873	I think a spirit of my blood laments
3874	The sin which down below there costs so much.”
3875	Then said the Master: “Be no longer broken
3876	Thy thought from this time forward upon him;
3877	Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;
3878	For him I saw below the little bridge,
3879	Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
3880	Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.
3881	So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
3882	By him who formerly held Altaforte,
3883	Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.”
3884	“O my Conductor, his own violent death,
3885	Which is not yet avenged for him,” I said,
3886	“By any who is sharer in the shame,
3887	Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
3888	As I imagine, without speaking to me,
3889	And thereby made me pity him the more.”
3890	Thus did we speak as far as the first place
3891	Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
3892	Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
3893	When we were now right over the last cloister
3894	Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
3895	Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
3896	Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,
3897	Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,
3898	Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.
3899	What pain would be, if from the hospitals
3900	Of Valdichiana, ’twixt July and September,
3901	And of Maremma and Sardinia
3902	All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
3903	Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
3904	As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
3905	We had descended on the furthest bank
3906	From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
3907	And then more vivid was my power of sight
3908	Down tow’rds the bottom, where the ministress
3909	Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
3910	Punishes forgers, which she here records.
3911	I do not think a sadder sight to see
3912	Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
3913	(When was the air so full of pestilence,
3914	The animals, down to the little worm,
3915	All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
3916	According as the poets have affirmed,
3917	Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
3918	Than was it to behold through that dark valley
3919	The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
3920	This on the belly, that upon the back
3921	One of the other lay, and others crawling
3922	Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
3923	We step by step went onward without speech,
3924	Gazing upon and listening to the sick
3925	Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
3926	I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
3927	As leans in heating platter against platter,
3928	From head to foot bespotted o’er with scabs;
3929	And never saw I plied a currycomb
3930	By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
3931	Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
3932	As every one was plying fast the bite
3933	Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
3934	Of itching which no other succour had.
3935	And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
3936	In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
3937	Or any other fish that has them largest.
3938	“O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,”
3939	Began my Leader unto one of them,
3940	“And makest of them pincers now and then,
3941	Tell me if any Latian is with those
3942	Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
3943	To all eternity unto this work.”
3944	“Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
3945	Both of us here,” one weeping made reply;
3946	“But who art thou, that questionest about us?”
3947	And said the Guide: “One am I who descends
3948	Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,
3949	And I intend to show Hell unto him.”
3950	Then broken was their mutual support,
3951	And trembling each one turned himself to me,
3952	With others who had heard him by rebound.
3953	Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
3954	Saying: “Say unto them whate’er thou wishest.”
3955	And I began, since he would have it so:
3956	“So may your memory not steal away
3957	In the first world from out the minds of men,
3958	But so may it survive ’neath many suns,
3959	Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
3960	Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
3961	Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”
3962	“I of Arezzo was,” one made reply,
3963	“And Albert of Siena had me burned;
3964	But what I died for does not bring me here.
3965	’Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
3966	That I could rise by flight into the air,
3967	And he who had conceit, but little wit,
3968	Would have me show to him the art; and only
3969	Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
3970	Be burned by one who held him as his son.
3971	But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
3972	For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
3973	Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.”
3974	And to the Poet said I: “Now was ever
3975	So vain a people as the Sienese?
3976	Not for a certainty the French by far.”
3977	Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
3978	Replied unto my speech: “Taking out Stricca,
3979	Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
3980	And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
3981	Of cloves discovered earliest of all
3982	Within that garden where such seed takes root;
3983	And taking out the band, among whom squandered
3984	Caccia d’Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
3985	And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
3986	But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
3987	Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
3988	Tow’rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
3989	And thou shalt see I am Capocchio’s shade,
3990	Who metals falsified by alchemy;
3991	Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
3992	How I a skilful ape of nature was.”

=== CANTO 30 ===
3993	’Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,
3994	For Semele, against the Theban blood,
3995	As she already more than once had shown,
3996	So reft of reason Athamas became,
3997	That, seeing his own wife with children twain
3998	Walking encumbered upon either hand,
3999	He cried: “Spread out the nets, that I may take
4000	The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;”
4001	And then extended his unpitying claws,
4002	Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
4003	And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
4004	And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;—
4005	And at the time when fortune downward hurled
4006	The Trojan’s arrogance, that all things dared,
4007	So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
4008	Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
4009	When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
4010	And of her Polydorus on the shore
4011	Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
4012	Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
4013	So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
4014	But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
4015	Were ever seen in any one so cruel
4016	In goading beasts, and much more human members,
4017	As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
4018	Who, biting, in the manner ran along
4019	That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
4020	One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
4021	Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
4022	It made his belly grate the solid bottom.
4023	And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
4024	Said to me: “That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
4025	And raving goes thus harrying other people.”
4026	“O,” said I to him, “so may not the other
4027	Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
4028	To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.”
4029	And he to me: “That is the ancient ghost
4030	Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
4031	Beyond all rightful love her father’s lover.
4032	She came to sin with him after this manner,
4033	By counterfeiting of another’s form;
4034	As he who goeth yonder undertook,
4035	That he might gain the lady of the herd,
4036	To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
4037	Making a will and giving it due form.”
4038	And after the two maniacs had passed
4039	On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
4040	To look upon the other evil-born.
4041	I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
4042	If he had only had the groin cut off
4043	Just at the point at which a man is forked.
4044	The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
4045	The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,
4046	That the face corresponds not to the belly,
4047	Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
4048	As does the hectic, who because of thirst
4049	One tow’rds the chin, the other upward turns.
4050	“O ye, who without any torment are,
4051	And why I know not, in the world of woe,”
4052	He said to us, “behold, and be attentive
4053	Unto the misery of Master Adam;
4054	I had while living much of what I wished,
4055	And now, alas! a drop of water crave.
4056	The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
4057	Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,
4058	Making their channels to be cold and moist,
4059	Ever before me stand, and not in vain;
4060	For far more doth their image dry me up
4061	Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
4062	The rigid justice that chastises me
4063	Draweth occasion from the place in which
4064	I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.
4065	There is Romena, where I counterfeited
4066	The currency imprinted with the Baptist,
4067	For which I left my body burned above.
4068	But if I here could see the tristful soul
4069	Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
4070	For Branda’s fount I would not give the sight.
4071	One is within already, if the raving
4072	Shades that are going round about speak truth;
4073	But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
4074	If I were only still so light, that in
4075	A hundred years I could advance one inch,
4076	I had already started on the way,
4077	Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
4078	Although the circuit be eleven miles,
4079	And be not less than half a mile across.
4080	For them am I in such a family;
4081	They did induce me into coining florins,
4082	Which had three carats of impurity.”
4083	And I to him: “Who are the two poor wretches
4084	That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
4085	Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?”
4086	“I found them here,” replied he, “when I rained
4087	Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
4088	Nor do I think they will for evermore.
4089	One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
4090	The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
4091	From acute fever they send forth such reek.”
4092	And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
4093	At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
4094	Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
4095	It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
4096	And Master Adam smote him in the face,
4097	With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
4098	Saying to him: “Although be taken from me
4099	All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
4100	I have an arm unfettered for such need.”
4101	Whereat he answer made: “When thou didst go
4102	Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
4103	But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.”
4104	The dropsical: “Thou sayest true in that;
4105	But thou wast not so true a witness there,
4106	Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”
4107	“If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,”
4108	Said Sinon; “and for one fault I am here,
4109	And thou for more than any other demon.”
4110	“Remember, perjurer, about the horse,”
4111	He made reply who had the swollen belly,
4112	“And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.”
4113	“Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
4114	Thy tongue,” the Greek said, “and the putrid water
4115	That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.”
4116	Then the false-coiner: “So is gaping wide
4117	Thy mouth for speaking evil, as ’tis wont;
4118	Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
4119	Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
4120	And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
4121	Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.”
4122	In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
4123	When said the Master to me: “Now just look,
4124	For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.”
4125	When him I heard in anger speak to me,
4126	I turned me round towards him with such shame
4127	That still it eddies through my memory.
4128	And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
4129	Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
4130	So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
4131	Such I became, not having power to speak,
4132	For to excuse myself I wished, and still
4133	Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
4134	“Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,”
4135	The Master said, “than this of thine has been;
4136	Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,
4137	And make account that I am aye beside thee,
4138	If e’er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
4139	Where there are people in a like dispute;
4140	For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.”

=== CANTO 31 ===
4141	One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
4142	So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
4143	And then held out to me the medicine;
4144	Thus do I hear that once Achilles’ spear,
4145	His and his father’s, used to be the cause
4146	First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
4147	We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
4148	Upon the bank that girds it round about,
4149	Going across it without any speech.
4150	There it was less than night, and less than day,
4151	So that my sight went little in advance;
4152	But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
4153	So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
4154	Which, counter to it following its way,
4155	Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
4156	After the dolorous discomfiture
4157	When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
4158	So terribly Orlando sounded not.
4159	Short while my head turned thitherward I held
4160	When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
4161	Whereat I: “Master, say, what town is this?”
4162	And he to me: “Because thou peerest forth
4163	Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,
4164	It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.
4165	Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,
4166	How much the sense deceives itself by distance;
4167	Therefore a little faster spur thee on.”
4168	Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
4169	And said: “Before we farther have advanced,
4170	That the reality may seem to thee
4171	Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,
4172	And they are in the well, around the bank,
4173	From navel downward, one and all of them.”
4174	As, when the fog is vanishing away,
4175	Little by little doth the sight refigure
4176	Whate’er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
4177	So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
4178	More and more near approaching tow’rd the verge,
4179	My error fled, and fear came over me;
4180	Because as on its circular parapets
4181	Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
4182	E’en thus the margin which surrounds the well
4183	With one half of their bodies turreted
4184	The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
4185	E’en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
4186	And I of one already saw the face,
4187	Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
4188	And down along his sides both of the arms.
4189	Certainly Nature, when she left the making
4190	Of animals like these, did well indeed,
4191	By taking such executors from Mars;
4192	And if of elephants and whales she doth not
4193	Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
4194	More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
4195	For where the argument of intellect
4196	Is added unto evil will and power,
4197	No rampart can the people make against it.
4198	His face appeared to me as long and large
4199	As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,
4200	And in proportion were the other bones;
4201	So that the margin, which an apron was
4202	Down from the middle, showed so much of him
4203	Above it, that to reach up to his hair
4204	Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
4205	For I beheld thirty great palms of him
4206	Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
4207	“Raphael mai amech izabi almi,”
4208	Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
4209	To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
4210	And unto him my Guide: “Soul idiotic,
4211	Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,
4212	When wrath or other passion touches thee.
4213	Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
4214	Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,
4215	And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.”
4216	Then said to me: “He doth himself accuse;
4217	This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
4218	One language in the world is not still used.
4219	Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;
4220	For even such to him is every language
4221	As his to others, which to none is known.”
4222	Therefore a longer journey did we make,
4223	Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
4224	We found another far more fierce and large.
4225	In binding him, who might the master be
4226	I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
4227	Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
4228	With chains, that held him so begirt about
4229	From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
4230	It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
4231	“This proud one wished to make experiment
4232	Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,”
4233	My Leader said, “whence he has such a guerdon.
4234	Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.
4235	What time the giants terrified the gods;
4236	The arms he wielded never more he moves.”
4237	And I to him: “If possible, I should wish
4238	That of the measureless Briareus
4239	These eyes of mine might have experience.”
4240	Whence he replied: “Thou shalt behold Antaeus
4241	Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,
4242	Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.
4243	Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,
4244	And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,
4245	Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.”
4246	There never was an earthquake of such might
4247	That it could shake a tower so violently,
4248	As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
4249	Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
4250	For nothing more was needful than the fear,
4251	If I had not beheld the manacles.
4252	Then we proceeded farther in advance,
4253	And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
4254	Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
4255	“O thou, who in the valley fortunate,
4256	Which Scipio the heir of glory made,
4257	When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,
4258	Once brought’st a thousand lions for thy prey,
4259	And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
4260	Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
4261	The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
4262	Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,
4263	There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.
4264	Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;
4265	This one can give of that which here is longed for;
4266	Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.
4267	Still in the world can he restore thy fame;
4268	Because he lives, and still expects long life,
4269	If to itself Grace call him not untimely.”
4270	So said the Master; and in haste the other
4271	His hands extended and took up my Guide,—
4272	Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
4273	Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
4274	Said unto me: “Draw nigh, that I may take thee;”
4275	Then of himself and me one bundle made.
4276	As seems the Carisenda, to behold
4277	Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
4278	Above it so that opposite it hangs;
4279	Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
4280	Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
4281	I could have wished to go some other way.
4282	But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
4283	Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
4284	Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
4285	But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.

=== CANTO 32 ===
4286	If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,
4287	As were appropriate to the dismal hole
4288	Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,
4289	I would press out the juice of my conception
4290	More fully; but because I have them not,
4291	Not without fear I bring myself to speak;
4292	For ’tis no enterprise to take in jest,
4293	To sketch the bottom of all the universe,
4294	Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.
4295	But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,
4296	Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,
4297	That from the fact the word be not diverse.
4298	O rabble ill-begotten above all,
4299	Who’re in the place to speak of which is hard,
4300	’Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
4301	When we were down within the darksome well,
4302	Beneath the giant’s feet, but lower far,
4303	And I was scanning still the lofty wall,
4304	I heard it said to me: “Look how thou steppest!
4305	Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
4306	The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!”
4307	Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me
4308	And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
4309	The semblance had of glass, and not of water.
4310	So thick a veil ne’er made upon its current
4311	In winter-time Danube in Austria,
4312	Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,
4313	As there was here; so that if Tambernich
4314	Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,
4315	E’en at the edge ’twould not have given a creak.
4316	And as to croak the frog doth place himself
4317	With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming
4318	Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—
4319	Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
4320	Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
4321	Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
4322	Each one his countenance held downward bent;
4323	From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
4324	Among them witness of itself procures.
4325	When round about me somewhat I had looked,
4326	I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
4327	The hair upon their heads together mingled.
4328	“Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,”
4329	I said, “who are you;” and they bent their necks,
4330	And when to me their faces they had lifted,
4331	Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
4332	Gushed o’er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
4333	The tears between, and locked them up again.
4334	Clamp never bound together wood with wood
4335	So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
4336	Butted together, so much wrath o’ercame them.
4337	And one, who had by reason of the cold
4338	Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
4339	Said: “Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
4340	If thou desire to know who these two are,
4341	The valley whence Bisenzio descends
4342	Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
4343	They from one body came, and all Caina
4344	Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
4345	More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
4346	Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
4347	At one and the same blow by Arthur’s hand;
4348	Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
4349	So with his head I see no farther forward,
4350	And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
4351	Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
4352	And that thou put me not to further speech,
4353	Know that I Camicion de’ Pazzi was,
4354	And wait Carlino to exonerate me.”
4355	Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
4356	Purple with cold; whence o’er me comes a shudder,
4357	And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
4358	And while we were advancing tow’rds the middle,
4359	Where everything of weight unites together,
4360	And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
4361	Whether ’twere will, or destiny, or chance,
4362	I know not; but in walking ’mong the heads
4363	I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
4364	Weeping he growled: “Why dost thou trample me?
4365	Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
4366	of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?”
4367	And I: “My Master, now wait here for me,
4368	That I through him may issue from a doubt;
4369	Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.”
4370	The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
4371	Who was blaspheming vehemently still:
4372	“Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?”
4373	“Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
4374	Smiting,” replied he, “other people’s cheeks,
4375	So that, if thou wert living, ’twere too much?”
4376	“Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,”
4377	Was my response, “if thou demandest fame,
4378	That ’mid the other notes thy name I place.”
4379	And he to me: “For the reverse I long;
4380	Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;
4381	For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.”
4382	Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,
4383	And said: “It must needs be thou name thyself,
4384	Or not a hair remain upon thee here.”
4385	Whence he to me: “Though thou strip off my hair,
4386	I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
4387	If on my head a thousand times thou fall.”
4388	I had his hair in hand already twisted,
4389	And more than one shock of it had pulled out,
4390	He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,
4391	When cried another: “What doth ail thee, Bocca?
4392	Is’t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
4393	But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?”
4394	“Now,” said I, “I care not to have thee speak,
4395	Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame
4396	I will report of thee veracious news.”
4397	“Begone,” replied he, “and tell what thou wilt,
4398	But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
4399	Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;
4400	He weepeth here the silver of the French;
4401	‘I saw,’ thus canst thou phrase it, ‘him of Duera
4402	There where the sinners stand out in the cold.’
4403	If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
4404	Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,
4405	Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;
4406	Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be
4407	Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello
4408	Who oped Faenza when the people slep.”
4409	Already we had gone away from him,
4410	When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
4411	So that one head a hood was to the other;
4412	And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
4413	The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
4414	There where the brain is to the nape united.
4415	Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
4416	The temples of Menalippus in disdain,
4417	Than that one did the skull and the other things.
4418	“O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
4419	Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
4420	Tell me the wherefore,” said I, “with this compact,
4421	That if thou rightfully of him complain,
4422	In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
4423	I in the world above repay thee for it,
4424	If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.”

=== CANTO 33 ===
4425	His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
4426	That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
4427	Of the same head that he behind had wasted.
4428	Then he began: “Thou wilt that I renew
4429	The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
4430	To think of only, ere I speak of it;
4431	But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
4432	Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
4433	Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.
4434	I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
4435	Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
4436	Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.
4437	Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
4438	And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;
4439	Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.
4440	That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
4441	Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
4442	And after put to death, I need not say;
4443	But ne’ertheless what thou canst not have heard,
4444	That is to say, how cruel was my death,
4445	Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
4446	A narrow perforation in the mew,
4447	Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
4448	And in which others still must be locked up,
4449	Had shown me through its opening many moons
4450	Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
4451	Which of the future rent for me the veil.
4452	This one appeared to me as lord and master,
4453	Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
4454	For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
4455	With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
4456	Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
4457	He had sent out before him to the front.
4458	After brief course seemed unto me forespent
4459	The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
4460	It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
4461	When I before the morrow was awake,
4462	Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
4463	Who with me were, and asking after bread.
4464	Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
4465	Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
4466	And weep’st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
4467	They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
4468	At which our food used to be brought to us,
4469	And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
4470	And I heard locking up the under door
4471	Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
4472	I gazed into the faces of my sons.
4473	I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
4474	They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
4475	Said: ‘Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?’
4476	Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
4477	All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
4478	Until another sun rose on the world.
4479	As now a little glimmer made its way
4480	Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
4481	Upon four faces my own very aspect,
4482	Both of my hands in agony I bit;
4483	And, thinking that I did it from desire
4484	Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
4485	And said they: ‘Father, much less pain ’twill give us
4486	If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
4487	With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.’
4488	I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
4489	That day we all were silent, and the next.
4490	Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
4491	When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
4492	Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
4493	Saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’
4494	And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
4495	I saw the three fall, one by one, between
4496	The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
4497	Already blind, to groping over each,
4498	And three days called them after they were dead;
4499	Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.”
4500	When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
4501	The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
4502	Which, as a dog’s, upon the bone were strong.
4503	Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
4504	Of the fair land there where the ‘Si’ doth sound,
4505	Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
4506	Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
4507	And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
4508	That every person in thee it may drown!
4509	For if Count Ugolino had the fame
4510	Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
4511	Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
4512	Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
4513	Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
4514	And the other two my song doth name above!
4515	We passed still farther onward, where the ice
4516	Another people ruggedly enswathes,
4517	Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
4518	Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
4519	And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
4520	Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
4521	Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
4522	And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
4523	Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
4524	And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
4525	Because of cold all sensibility
4526	Its station had abandoned in my face,
4527	Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
4528	Whence I: “My Master, who sets this in motion?
4529	Is not below here every vapour quenched?”
4530	Whence he to me: “Full soon shalt thou be where
4531	Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,
4532	Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.”
4533	And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
4534	Cried out to us: “O souls so merciless
4535	That the last post is given unto you,
4536	Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
4537	May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
4538	A little, e’er the weeping recongeal.”
4539	Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee
4540	Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
4541	May I go to the bottom of the ice.”
4542	Then he replied: “I am Friar Alberigo;
4543	He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
4544	Who here a date am getting for my fig.”
4545	“O,” said I to him, “now art thou, too, dead?”
4546	And he to me: “How may my body fare
4547	Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.
4548	Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,
4549	That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
4550	Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.
4551	And, that thou mayest more willingly remove
4552	From off my countenance these glassy tears,
4553	Know that as soon as any soul betrays
4554	As I have done, his body by a demon
4555	Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,
4556	Until his time has wholly been revolved.
4557	Itself down rushes into such a cistern;
4558	And still perchance above appears the body
4559	Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.
4560	This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;
4561	It is Ser Branca d’ Oria, and many years
4562	Have passed away since he was thus locked up.”
4563	“I think,” said I to him, “thou dost deceive me;
4564	For Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,
4565	And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.”
4566	“In moat above,” said he, “of Malebranche,
4567	There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,
4568	As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,
4569	When this one left a devil in his stead
4570	In his own body and one near of kin,
4571	Who made together with him the betrayal.
4572	But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,
4573	Open mine eyes;”—and open them I did not,
4574	And to be rude to him was courtesy.
4575	Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance
4576	With every virtue, full of every vice
4577	Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
4578	For with the vilest spirit of Romagna
4579	I found of you one such, who for his deeds
4580	In soul already in Cocytus bathes,
4581	And still above in body seems alive!

=== CANTO 34 ===
4582	“‘Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni’
4583	Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,”
4584	My Master said, “if thou discernest him.”
4585	As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
4586	Our hemisphere is darkening into night,
4587	Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,
4588	Methought that such a building then I saw;
4589	And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
4590	My Guide, because there was no other shelter.
4591	Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,
4592	There where the shades were wholly covered up,
4593	And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.
4594	Some prone are lying, others stand erect,
4595	This with the head, and that one with the soles;
4596	Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.
4597	When in advance so far we had proceeded,
4598	That it my Master pleased to show to me
4599	The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
4600	He from before me moved and made me stop,
4601	Saying: “Behold Dis, and behold the place
4602	Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.”
4603	How frozen I became and powerless then,
4604	Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
4605	Because all language would be insufficient.
4606	I did not die, and I alive remained not;
4607	Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
4608	What I became, being of both deprived.
4609	The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
4610	From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
4611	And better with a giant I compare
4612	Than do the giants with those arms of his;
4613	Consider now how great must be that whole,
4614	Which unto such a part conforms itself.
4615	Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
4616	And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
4617	Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
4618	O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
4619	When I beheld three faces on his head!
4620	The one in front, and that vermilion was;
4621	Two were the others, that were joined with this
4622	Above the middle part of either shoulder,
4623	And they were joined together at the crest;
4624	And the right-hand one seemed ’twixt white and yellow;
4625	The left was such to look upon as those
4626	Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
4627	Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
4628	Such as befitting were so great a bird;
4629	Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
4630	No feathers had they, but as of a bat
4631	Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
4632	So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
4633	Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
4634	With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
4635	Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
4636	At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
4637	A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
4638	So that he three of them tormented thus.
4639	To him in front the biting was as naught
4640	Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
4641	Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
4642	“That soul up there which has the greatest pain,”
4643	The Master said, “is Judas Iscariot;
4644	With head inside, he plies his legs without.
4645	Of the two others, who head downward are,
4646	The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
4647	See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.
4648	And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.
4649	But night is reascending, and ’tis time
4650	That we depart, for we have seen the whole.”
4651	As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
4652	And he the vantage seized of time and place,
4653	And when the wings were opened wide apart,
4654	He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
4655	From fell to fell descended downward then
4656	Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
4657	When we were come to where the thigh revolves
4658	Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
4659	The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
4660	Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
4661	And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
4662	So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
4663	“Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,”
4664	The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
4665	“Must we perforce depart from so much evil.”
4666	Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
4667	And down upon the margin seated me;
4668	Then tow’rds me he outstretched his wary step.
4669	I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
4670	Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
4671	And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
4672	And if I then became disquieted,
4673	Let stolid people think who do not see
4674	What the point is beyond which I had passed.
4675	“Rise up,” the Master said, “upon thy feet;
4676	The way is long, and difficult the road,
4677	And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.”
4678	It was not any palace corridor
4679	There where we were, but dungeon natural,
4680	With floor uneven and unease of light.
4681	“Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
4682	My Master,” said I when I had arisen,
4683	“To draw me from an error speak a little;
4684	Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
4685	Thus upside down? and how in such short time
4686	From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?”
4687	And he to me: “Thou still imaginest
4688	Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
4689	The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.
4690	That side thou wast, so long as I descended;
4691	When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
4692	To which things heavy draw from every side,
4693	And now beneath the hemisphere art come
4694	Opposite that which overhangs the vast
4695	Dry-land, and ’neath whose cope was put to death
4696	The Man who without sin was born and lived.
4697	Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
4698	Which makes the other face of the Judecca.
4699	Here it is morn when it is evening there;
4700	And he who with his hair a stairway made us
4701	Still fixed remaineth as he was before.
4702	Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;
4703	And all the land, that whilom here emerged,
4704	For fear of him made of the sea a veil,
4705	And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
4706	To flee from him, what on this side appears
4707	Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.”
4708	A place there is below, from Beelzebub
4709	As far receding as the tomb extends,
4710	Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
4711	Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
4712	Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
4713	With course that winds about and slightly falls.
4714	The Guide and I into that hidden road
4715	Now entered, to return to the bright world;
4716	And without care of having any rest
4717	We mounted up, he first and I the second,
4718	Till I beheld through a round aperture
4719	Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
4720	Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.
4721	PURGATORIO
