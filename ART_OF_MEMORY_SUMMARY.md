# Art of Memory (artofmemory.com) — Research Summary

## Overview

Art of Memory is a comprehensive platform dedicated to memory techniques, mental training, and competitive memorization. The site offers over 5,000 pages of free content, interactive software, and an active community forum.

**Core Mission:** Teach the same mnemonic techniques used by world memory champions and make them accessible for everyday learning.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Memory Palace (Method of Loci)

The foundational technique. An imaginary location in your mind where you store mnemonic images.

**How it works:**
- Choose a familiar place (home, school, route through town)
- Identify specific locations (loci) along a mental journey
- Place mnemonic images at each location
- Recall by mentally walking the same route

**Origins:** Goes back to prehistoric times and appears across many cultures. Western historical records trace to Simonides of Ceos (~6th century BCE), with written accounts in Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero's De Oratore, and Quintilian.

**Also known as:** Mind palace, Roman room system, journey method.

### 2. The Major System

A phonetic system for converting numbers into words.

**The code:**
| Digit | Sounds |
|-------|--------|
| 0 | s, z, soft c |
| 1 | t, d, th |
| 2 | n |
| 3 | m |
| 4 | r |
| 5 | l |
| 6 | j, sh, soft ch, soft g |
| 7 | k, hard c, hard g |
| 8 | f, v |
| 9 | p, b |

Vowels are ignored, allowing flexible word creation. Example: 32 = MN sounds = "moon" or "money".

### 3. The Dominic System

Created by 8-time World Memory Champion Dominic O'Brien.

**How it works:**
- Each 2-digit number (00-99) maps to letter pairs
- Letters suggest a person and an action
- Encodes 4 digits at a time into compound images

**Example:** 07 = OG = Ozzy (biting a bat), 32 could = Magic Johnson (playing basketball)

Can be expanded to PAO for even greater compression.

### 4. PAO System (Person-Action-Object)

Advanced technique for competition memorization.

**Structure:**
- Each 2-digit number (00-99) has an assigned Person, Action, and Object
- When memorizing, combine Person from first pair, Action from second, Object from third
- Compresses 6 digits into 1 memorable image
- Yields 1 million possible unique images

### 5. Peg Lists

Pre-memorized ordered lists that act as "pegs" for new information.

**Common types:**
- Number-shape system (1 looks like a candle, 2 looks like a swan)
- Number-rhyme system (1 = bun, 2 = shoe)
- Major system pegs (1 = tie, 2 = Noah)

### 6. Link and Story Methods

Chain facts together into linked sequences through narrative connections.

## Applications

### What People Memorize

Memory League competition records demonstrate what's possible:
- 80 random digits in < 13 seconds
- Shuffled deck of cards in < 13 seconds
- 30 names and faces in < 40 seconds
- 50 random words in < 35 seconds
- 30 random pictures in < 10 seconds

**World Record (Speed Cards):** 12.74 seconds — Shijir-Erdene Bat-Enkh

### Practical Uses

- Language learning and vocabulary
- Speeches and presentations
- Academic study (history, science, law)
- Professional certifications
- Shopping lists and daily recall
- Names and faces

## Platform Resources

### Memory League

Online training and competition platform:
- Head-to-head matches against others worldwide
- Seasonal championship leagues
- Training modes for: Cards, Numbers, Words, Names, Images

### Card Memorization Systems

Three main approaches:
1. **1-card system:** Each card = one fixed image
2. **2-card systems:** Each pair = one image (Ben System, Shadow System, Trochee System)
3. **PAO system:** Each card has Person/Action/Object; 3 cards per memory palace location

## Key Principles

1. **Association:** Connect new information to what you already know
2. **Visualization:** Convert abstract data into vivid mental pictures
3. **Location:** Use spatial memory (memory palaces) to organize and sequence
4. **Exaggeration:** Make images unusual, emotional, or absurd for better retention
5. **Practice:** "Train out of your comfort zone. Speed trumps accuracy because accuracy follows speed."
