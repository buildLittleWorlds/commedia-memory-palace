# Memory Palace Image Generation — Experiment Log

## Goal

Experiment with AI image generation to create **visual images of World 1 locations** — the mnemonic infrastructure that W2 participants use to "memorize our world."

## The Framing

**W2 creates W1.** Densworld is not an independent reality — it is a vivid imaginary world constructed by a loose network of W2 artists, coders, game designers, and writers as a memory palace system. The images we generate are not "reconstructions" of something that exists elsewhere. They are the **construction itself** — visual build-stones for anchoring memory.

See `W1_W2_REFRAME.md` for full documentation.

## Key Questions to Explore

1. **What makes a good memory palace image?**
   - How many loci can one image hold while remaining distinct?
   - What level of detail/complexity works best?
   - Realistic vs. stylized — which sticks better?

2. **What prompt structures produce usable results?**
   - JSON-structured (Nano Banana Pro style) vs. natural language
   - How specific should loci descriptions be in the prompt?
   - Can we generate numbered/labeled loci reliably?

3. **What types of spaces work?**
   - Interior rooms vs. outdoor paths
   - Familiar architectural styles vs. fantastical
   - Dense (many loci) vs. sparse (few, very distinct loci)

4. **Series consistency**
   - Can we generate multiple views of the same palace?
   - How well does reference image consistency work?
