In the foreground on the left, a worn leather satchel sits open on the ground, spilling rolled maps and a brass compass with only three directions marked. Beside it in the center foreground, a clay bowl holds dried maize kernels, some scattered on the dusty canvas floor. To the right foreground, iron tent stakes are driven into clod-mud, with frayed rope still attached. In the middle distance rising toward the back, the scene opens to the encampment. On the right side, a cooking fire smolders under a blackened iron pot, steam curling upward. At center back, a siege ladder leans against stacked supply crates, its rungs worn smooth. On the left in the background, a torn regimental banner hangs limp from a pole, its insignia barely visible. Beyond all this, the Tower of Mirado hovers in the distance—steel-gray and luminous, its crown fountain catching light. The color palette draws from Densworld materials: Quarry Ochre and Clod-mud Earth for warm earth tones, Tower Steel Gray for metallic elements, Iron Gall Black for shadows and ink-like details, Desert Maize Yellow for highlights. Cartographic illustration style with clean lines, unified lighting from top-left, deep focus keeping all elements sharp. Aspect ratio 16:9. One continuous scene, not separate panels. Six distinct objects clearly separated by negative space."

To the right foreground, a tin lunch pail sits open, revealing a crust of bread and an apple core. In the middle distance on the right side, a gnarled yeller-oak grows from a crack in the quarry wall, its roots gripping the stone. At center back, a surveyor's tripod stands abandoned on a ledge, brass telescope tilted toward the pit floor. On the left in the background, a coil of hemp rope hangs from an iron spike driven into the rock face. The quarry descends in golden-brown terraces toward the pit floor where Prime Yeller veins catch fading light. Dust hangs in the amber dusk air.

To the right foreground, a wooden filing cabinet drawer hangs open, documents spilling onto the floor. In the middle distance on the right side, a high-backed reading chair faces away, its leather cracked and worn. At center back, a tall window lets in the first gray light, an iron latch hanging loose. On the left in the background, a wall-mounted gas lamp flickers, its glass shade darkened with soot. Morning light filters through dust motes. The archive stretches into shadow beyond the reading alcoves.

In the middle distance on the right side, stilted shanty pylons rise from the water, their wood blackened and slick. At center back, the silhouette of the Broken Deadriver Bridge hangs half-collapsed against a starless sky, its central span sagging into the current.

The moment after the Maw Beast struck. In the foreground on the left, Ox kneels in the mud, dragging Truck's body by the collar—Truck's face is turned away, obscured. Ox's rope-calloused hands grip the fabric. In the center foreground, a shattered lantern lies on the cave floor, its oil still burning in a spreading pool, casting wild shadows. To the right foreground, a discarded trapping hook—the Boss's signature tool with red-dyed grip—lies where she dropped it when the creature threw her. In the middle distance on the right side, the Maw Beast's bulk retreats into shadow, its form massive and hunched, visible only as a silhouette of bristled hide and too many limbs. At center back, the cave narrows toward the depths, Prime Yeller veins catching the firelight in golden threads against the black stone. On the left in the background, a figure in a maze-braided red hair—the Boss—lies crumpled against the cave wall, one arm raised as if reaching. The cave smells of blood, oil, and yeller dust. Someone is screaming. The color palette draws from Densworld materials: Grimslew Scale Black (#030712) for the deepest cave shadows, Quarry Ochre (#B45309) for the Yeller veins and firelight, Iron Gall Black (#1F2937) for wet rock and blood, Dead River Silt Gray (#78716C) for mud and exhausted flesh.

        "prompt_text": "A unified exterior illustration of the Focal Meadow crater rim at dusk, Year 799, viewed from behind Bincher as she witnesses Nelphl's final moments. In the foreground on the left, Bincher's leather-bound field journal lies open on the grass, her handwriting trailing off mid-sentence. In the center foreground, dried fish wrapped in cloth—her uneaten meal—sits beside the journal, forgotten. To the right foreground, a Metal-Beaked Finch perches on a stone, its distinctive iron-colored beak tilted toward the crater. In the middle distance on the right side, Nelphl kneels at the crater's edge, her loose dark hair falling across her face as she leans forward. At center back, the smooth rim of the Focal Meadow crater curves away, its surface impossibly regular, the depression beyond filled with evening shadow. On the left in the background, Bincher herself stands frozen, one arm raised as if to call out or reach—but it's too late. The meadow grass ripples in a wind that seems to pull toward the crater. The sky is copper and gray. Something is ending. The color palette draws from Densworld materials: Meadow Oxidized Copper (#78350F) for the evening sky and grass shadows, Dead River Silt Gray (#78716C) for the crater rim, Iron Gall Black (#1F2937) for the deepening shadows, Quarry Ochre (#B45309) for the warm light on skin and cloth. Cartographic illustration style with clean lines, unified lighting from the setting sun, deep focus keeping all elements sharp. Aspect ratio 16:9. One continuous scene, not separate panels. Six distinct objects clearly separated by negative space. No title banners or labels."
